/**
 * A gate nobody runs is not a gate.
 *
 * `check:spec-copy` had an npm script, a careful header, and NO invocation
 * anywhere in CI. It had therefore never run — in this repository or the
 * parent — from the day it was written. It was found only because wiring a
 * different gate meant reading the workflow beside it, and when it was finally
 * run it had three real findings waiting, one of them a locator searching for
 * copy the app had deliberately removed.
 *
 * The parent repository has had this check for its own `scripts/` since the
 * same failure happened there. This submodule did not, which is why six more
 * gates were in the same state.
 *
 * The rule: every `check:*` npm script must be named by a step in a workflow,
 * or appear here with the reason it is not — and the reason must say what it
 * NEEDS, not merely that it is inconvenient, so that a reader can tell a gate
 * waiting on infrastructure from a gate quietly abandoned.
