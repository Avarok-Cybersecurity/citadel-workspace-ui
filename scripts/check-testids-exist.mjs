/**
 * Every `data-testid` a spec addresses is rendered by the app.
 *
 * `check-controls-are-addressed-by-testid.mjs` argues the other direction: do
 * not press a control by the words on it, give it a testid. Nothing checked
 * that the testid then EXISTS. So a spec could address `workspace-switcher`
 * and `workspace-name`, neither of which the app renders, and the lookup would
 * simply match nothing -- three seconds of waiting per run, then a fallback on
 * a chevron's CSS class, with the intended path permanently dead.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the `peer-row` heading and the Deregister/Disconnect
 * button labels: a selector that cannot match reads exactly like a feature that
 * is broken, and a fallback makes it read like one that works.
 *
 * Testids reach the DOM four ways here, and this check learned each one the
 * hard way while being written -- every widening removed false positives, not
 * real ones:
 *
 *   data-testid="x"                    a plain attribute
 *   data-testid={`x-${id}`}            a JSX template, matched by prefix
 *   testId: "x"  /  testId="x"         a config object or prop (LoadingModal)
 *   'data-testid': `x-${id}`           a quoted property key (ThemePreview)

 * run before telling somebody a deployment is ready, and it presses eight of
 * them. A rename in this repo silently breaks either one, and both fail in the
 * way that is hardest to read: a lookup that matches nothing looks exactly
 * like a product that is broken.
 *
 * That is the same rule enforced in one of the two places its mechanism
 * appears -- the most common defect class in this tree. The parent is at
 * `../` from here in both topologies that matter: the submodule checkout, and
 * this repo's own CI, which clones the parent to `parent/` and this repo to
 * `parent/citadel-workspaces`. A standalone clone of this repo alone has no
 * parent, which is legitimate, so a missing directory narrows the scan instead
 * of failing -- and the success line below REPORTS how many roots were read,
 * so the narrowing cannot happen quietly.

 * union -- `[data-testid="x"], .x` -- where the spec kept working through the
 * other half while this half matched nothing. Round 420 showed the cost: a
 * folder whose deletion had been removed from the tree, persisted AND
 * acknowledged by the peer still read as "still visible in tree", because the
 * surviving half of the union matched a path label.
 *
 * They closed in both directions, which is worth remembering the next time one
 * appears. Five became real names on real elements -- the group conversation
 * log, each message, the direct-message surface, the hierarchy section, the
 * workspace switcher. Three were deleted instead, because the app rendering a
 * name nothing needs is inventing surface to justify a dead reference.
