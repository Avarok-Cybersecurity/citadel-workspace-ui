/**
 * The best-practices shortfall CI is allowed, and only when it is exactly this.
 *
 * Lighthouse audits the bundle with no agent behind the `/ws` proxy, so two
 * audits fail every run and best-practices lands on 93 against a 95 floor,
 * permanently:
 *
 *   errors-in-console  the WASM client cannot open its socket, reported once
 *                      per layer as the failure propagates. Not an artificial
 *                      state: the deployed UI never proxies the agent, so this
 *                      is what someone sees before starting their own, and the
 *                      app handles it with a Connection Failed dialog.
 *   valid-source-maps  Lighthouse FETCHES each map, so on a loaded runner it
 *                      reports "missing" against a build whose maps are
 *                      correct — it appears in some CI runs and not others.
 *                      check-source-maps.mjs asks the same question of the
 *                      files on disk, where the answer cannot flicker, and
 *                      that is the gate that actually guards this.
 *   inspector-issues   cbor-x probes for `new Function` inside a try/catch and
 *                      falls back to its interpreted path when the policy
 *                      refuses. Chrome logs the refusal anyway. Allowing
 *                      'unsafe-eval' to silence it would trade a real security
 *                      boundary for a quieter report.
 *
 * Neither is a regression signal, and a gate that can never pass is one people
 * learn to re-run without reading. Lowering the floor to 93 would have hidden
 * the next real best-practices problem too, so the shortfall is accepted only
 * when EVERY failing audit is one of these two AND its contents are what we
 * expect. A third audit, a console error that is not the absent agent, or an
 * inspector issue that is not the policy, still fails the build.
 *
 * Accepting CSP issues here is not a hole: check-production-image.mjs gates
 * them precisely against the real nginx policy, failing on every violation
 * type except the eval probe. That is the authority for CSP, not this.

// Two spellings of the same failure. The app reports "WebSocket connection

// it stayed invisible while the printout truncated each audit to three items.
// Still specific: it requires a websocket connection that failed, so a
