/**
 * axe against the screens a visitor meets before they have an account.
 *
 * There is already an accessibility spec — `integration-tests/src/tests-pw/
 * accessibility.spec.ts` — and it is better than this one: it signs in and
 * covers the workspace. It also needs a backend, an account and a completed
 * registration, so when registration breaks it stops running, and it stops
 * running silently.
 *
 * That is the shape round 188 recorded: `check-mobile-layout.mjs` spent weeks
 * timing out behind an earlier failure in the same job, and a dead check behind
 * a failing check is indistinguishable from a passing one. The pre-auth screens
 * need nothing but a served bundle, so their accessibility should not depend on
 * whether an account can be created.
 *
 * Includes `wcag22aa`, which the spec does not: WCAG 2.2 is where target size
 * lives, and three controls were found at 21px against its 24px floor.
 *
 * Gated on `serious` and `critical`, matching the spec — `minor` and `moderate`
 * are dominated by advice that would make this a running argument with the
 * designer rather than a defect gate.
