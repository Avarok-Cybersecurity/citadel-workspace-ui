/**
 * Checks the first-run screens at phone width for the two failures that make an
 * installed app feel broken on a phone, neither of which axe reports.
 *
 * 1. Horizontal overflow. One element wider than the viewport makes the whole
 *    page scroll sideways, and every subsequent tap lands slightly off.
 * 2. Tap targets under 24x24 CSS px — the WCAG 2.2 floor. axe measures colour,
 *    names and roles, not size, so a 16px control passes every accessibility
 *    gate already in place while being genuinely hard to hit with a thumb.
 *    Three shipped that way: the landing Settings link, the password reveal,
 *    and the close button on EVERY dialog in the app.
 *
 * Pre-auth screens only, so it needs no backend and runs beside the other
 * production-bundle checks. That is also where it matters most: these are the
 * screens someone meets before they have any reason to persevere.
