/**
 * Every module under src/ is reached by an import.
 *
 * The Rust half of this (`check-rust-modules-are-compiled.mjs`) was written
 * after `handlers/permissions.rs` turned out to sit behind a commented-out
 * `mod` declaration, carrying a role table that contradicted the one
 * enforcement should use. TypeScript has no `mod` line, so the same thing hides
 * differently: the file compiles, type-checks, lints and reads as maintained,
 * and nothing imports it.
 *
 * That is how a second answer survives. `lib/live-document-store/document-queries.ts`
 * exports `getRootHash`, `getCreatorCid`, `isCreator` and `getRevisionChain`,
 * and `lib/yjs-merkle-strategy/tree.ts` has all four as methods that callers
 * actually use. Whichever is right, one of them is answering nobody.
 *
 * Config-referenced files are entry points, not orphans: `vitest.config.ts`
 * names `test/setup.ts` in `setupFiles` and `test/pwa-register-stub.ts` in
 * `resolve.alias`, so both are read from there rather than imported.
