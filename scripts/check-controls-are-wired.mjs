/**
 * A form control that stores nothing must not look like it stores something.
 *
 * `ChatSettingsPanel`'s Advanced tab shipped three controls with `defaultValue`,
 * no `value`, no `onChange`, no store and no consumer — among them a select
 * labelled "Encryption Level: Security level for this conversation". Choosing
 * "Maximum" changed nothing, and nothing read it.
 *
 * The comment on the switches directly above them says why that is not
 * tolerable in this product:
 *
 *   they were uncontrolled `Switch defaultChecked` here, with no handler and no
 *   store … On a product whose subject is privacy, a switch that lies about
 *   what you are broadcasting is the worst kind to fake.
 *
 * Those switches were fixed and their three siblings in the same panel were
 * not — the reason written directly above the place it was not applied.
 *
 * So: an uncontrolled control must either be `disabled` (the honest state for
 * something this build cannot act on, which `PrivacySettingsTab` pairs with a
 * note saying so) or carry a change handler. A `defaultValue` with neither is a
 * control that accepts input and discards it.
 *
 * Node 18-compatible on purpose: the lint jobs run the oldest supported Node.
