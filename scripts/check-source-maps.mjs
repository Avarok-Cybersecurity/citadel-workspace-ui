/**
 * Every emitted JS chunk ships a usable source map.
 *
 * Lighthouse has a `valid-source-maps` audit, but it fetches each map over the
 * network and reports "missing" when the fetch does not land — so on a loaded
 * CI runner it fails intermittently against a build whose maps are perfectly
 * correct. That is a measurement of the runner, not of the artefact.
 *
 * This asks the same question of the files on disk, where the answer cannot
 * flicker: for every chunk, is there a `sourceMappingURL`, does the map it
 * names exist, and does that map carry `sourcesContent` (without which a stack
 * trace still cannot be resolved back to source)?
 *
 * Run after `npm run build`.
