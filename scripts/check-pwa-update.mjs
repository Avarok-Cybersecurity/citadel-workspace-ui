/**
 * Verifies the promise the app makes when it says "A new version of Citadel is
 * ready" — that an ALREADY-INSTALLED app notices a deployment and offers the
 * user the reload, rather than serving yesterday's bundle forever.
 *
 * This is the upgrade half of the PWA lifecycle, and the half that fails
 * silently. An installed service worker keeps serving its cached bundle by
 * design; if the update path is broken, nothing errors, no user complains, and
 * the app simply stops changing. The unit test beside PwaUpdatePrompt mocks
 * `virtual:pwa-register/react`, so it proves the component reacts to
 * `needRefresh` — it cannot prove anything ever SETS it.
 *
 * A deployment is simulated the way a real one presents itself to a browser:
 * the bytes of sw.js change. That is the only signal the update algorithm uses,
 * so reproducing it is faithful rather than approximate. dist/ is copied first
 * and the copy is mutated, so the artefact the other checks share is untouched.
 *
 * Served from a plain static server rather than `vite preview`, because this
 * needs to rewrite a file mid-session and preview owns its own directory.
