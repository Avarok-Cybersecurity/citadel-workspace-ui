/**
 * Every consumer of `PeerRegisterFailure` must treat "already registered" as
 * success.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md states the rule under "CID Lifecycle":
 *
 *   Registrations are stored by CID pairs, and the CID never changes. After a
 *   disconnect and reconnect the same registrations exist on the server.
 *   "Peer Already Registered" is NOT an Error — treat this as success.
 *
 * The agent answers `PeerRegisterFailure` for it
 * (`citadel-internal-service/.../requests/peer/register.rs`), so every place
 * that reads that variant has to know the rule. Three did.
 * `peer-registration-store/accept-matcher.ts` did not — and its caller awaits it
 * on the line before `connectToPeer`, so the rejection skipped the connect and
 * no P2P channel was opened at all. Six specs failed on it, and the agent log
 * showed every send going `to SERVER (no peer_cid)` with not one
 * `[PeerChannelCreated]`.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately shallow: a module that reads `PeerRegisterFailure`
 * must mention `already registered` somewhere. It does not check WHAT the module
 * does with it — that is a judgement per call site — only that the case was
 * considered at all. Every instance of this defect so far has been a site where
 * nobody thought about it, not one that thought about it and chose wrongly.
 *
 * ITS LIMIT. This requires the shared predicate to be CALLED; it does not check
 * what the caller then does with the answer. Ignoring the return value would
 * pass. That is the judgement each call site has to make — one resolves a
 * promise, one marks a row registered, one clears an outgoing record — and every
 * instance of this defect so far has been a site that never asked the question
 * at all.
 *
 * An earlier version required the TEXT "already registered" anywhere in the
 * file. A negative control showed a `debugLog` string satisfied it with the
 * guard deleted, so it distinguished prose from code and nothing more. Requiring
 * the call is what a control can actually hold.
