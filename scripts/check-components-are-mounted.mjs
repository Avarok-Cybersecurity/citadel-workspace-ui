/**
 * A component nobody renders, kept alive by its own test.
 *
 * `PeerRefusalNotice` and `PersistFailureNotice` render nothing and exist only
 * to be mounted: each subscribes to an event and raises a notice. Delete the
 * one line in App.tsx that mounts one and everything still passes — the
 * component's tests render it directly and go green, and
 * `check-modules-are-imported` sees it imported, because the TEST file imports
 * it. Removing `PeerRefusalNotice` from App.tsx entirely left that gate
 * reporting "1266 file(s), all imported ok".
 *
 * That is the exact shape this campaign keeps finding: a feature built from one
 * end, where the half that is missing is the half nothing asserts. A notice
 * that is never mounted is a control that operates on nothing, and it looks
 * like working, tested code.
 *
 * So: every exported component must be RENDERED somewhere in production code —
 * as `<Name`, as `component={Name}`, or as `element={<Name`. Rendering inside
 * its own module counts: a helper used by the exported parent beside it is
 * mounted through that parent.
 *
 * Test files count on neither side. A component rendered only by its own test
 * is precisely the defect.
 *
 * There is no baseline. The tree passes this outright, and a gate that starts
 * at zero should stay at zero.
