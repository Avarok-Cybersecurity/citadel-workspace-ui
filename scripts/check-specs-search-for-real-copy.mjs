/**
 * A spec may not search for words the app does not contain.
 *
 * Four rounds in a row were the same defect: a locator pinned to a label the
 * product improved. Each one cost a CI leg and read as something else entirely.
 *
 *   - `CONNECTED PEERS` -- the members list was given one noun, and from that
 *     day every P2P connection was reported as failed. Three sites.
 *   - `LIVE DOCS` / `Create Live Doc` -- `createLiveDoc` clicked nothing and
 *     honestly reported the document missing. The whole of test:live-doc.
 *   - `Edit MDX Content` -- the label became "Can edit MDX documents", and a
 *     375px layout guard stopped executing while its failure read as a broken
 *     test.
 *   - `Connect` -- the button says "Sign In". Three legs.
 *
 * None of these announces itself. A locator that matches nothing waits out its
 * timeout, or falls through to the next strategy, and the failure names the
 * feature rather than the string.
 *
 * The rule is not "never mention copy". Asserting that the UI SAYS something is
 * exactly right. The rule is that a string a spec searches for must exist in the
 * app, or be data the spec itself created, and the second case has to be said
 * out loud rather than assumed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, stated plainly because a guard that overstates its reach
 * is worse than none:
 *
 *   1. WHICH SCREEN the string is on. It asks only whether the app contains it
 *      anywhere. `member-list-loading.spec.ts` searched the sidebar for
 *      "No members yet"; the sidebar has never said that, but `DirectoryTabContent`
 *      does, so this gate passed it — and the spec's one load-bearing assertion
 *      could not fail. Verified by control: restoring that exact locator today is
 *      still reported as clean. Only the testid check below catches it, because
 *      `members-empty` belongs to one component.
 *   2. Regex locators (`/No members yet/i`), which are not reconstructible here.
 *   3. `getByRole(..., { name })`, and attribute selectors like `#server`.
 *
 * 2 and 3 are open. They are the forms the suite increasingly prefers, so the
 * coverage here is narrower than the file name suggests.
