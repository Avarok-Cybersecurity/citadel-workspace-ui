/**
 * A gate that rewrites its own baseline, left uncommitted, stops being a gate.
 *
 * Three checks here ratchet against a baseline file and REWRITE that file in
 * the working tree when the count improves, then exit 1 asking for the new
 * count to be committed. That works exactly once. The first local run fails
 * loudly; every run after it compares against the rewritten file and passes,
 * while CI keeps comparing against the committed one and keeps failing.
 *
 * It has happened three times in this tree. The last was round 455: a spec
 * swapped a copy-addressed press for a testid, 132 became 131, the baseline was
 * rewritten and never staged, and the local preflight said "all checks passed"
 * for three more rounds while CI failed on it.
 *
 * The leftover is mechanically visible -- a tracked baseline with unstaged
 * changes -- so this reports it as its own failure instead of leaving it to be
 * discovered in a red run. In CI the checkout is clean, so this passes unless a
 * gate actually rewrote something, which is the same condition.
