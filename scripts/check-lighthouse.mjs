/**
 * Lighthouse gate for the production build.
 *
 * Serves `dist/` and audits the landing page, then holds each category to a
 * baseline. Run after `npm run build`.
 *
 * On the baselines, and why they are not all the same:
 *
 *   accessibility   1.00  deterministic. It is a rule check, not a measurement,
 *                         and it passes at 100 today — anything less is a real
 *                         regression somebody introduced.
 *   seo             1.00  same reasoning.
 *   best-practices  0.95  near-deterministic; measured 0.96.
 *   performance     0.70  a MEASUREMENT, and the only one that varies with the
 *                         machine. Measured 0.83 locally; a shared CI runner is
 *                         slower and noisier. A tight performance gate produces
 *                         a flaky red build, and a flaky gate is worse than no
 *                         gate — people learn to re-run it without reading it.
 *                         The floor is set to catch a real collapse (a bundle
 *                         blowing up, a render-blocking script) rather than
 *                         drift, and the actual score is always printed so a
 *                         downward trend is visible before it trips.
 *
 * Bundle size is gated separately and precisely by check-bundle-budget.mjs,
 * which IS deterministic — that is the tool for catching perf drift.

 * failed the build for the runner's load rather than for anything in the app —
