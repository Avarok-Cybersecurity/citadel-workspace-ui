/**
 * The world a browser-driving gate measures.
 *
 * `vite preview` proxies `/ws` to `127.0.0.1:${AGENT_PORT ?? 12345}`. On a
 * developer's machine that is their live stack; in CI it is nothing at all. So a
 * gate that spawns the preview and says nothing about the agent measures two
 * different applications depending on where it runs — and the difference is not
 * subtle. With no agent the "Connection Failed" modal opens over whatever screen
 * is showing and traps focus, so assertions scoped to `[role="dialog"]` land on
 * the modal rather than the screen they name.
 *
 * That cost a red CI leg and a wrong-surface bug in `check-accessibility.mjs`
 * (round 223). Four more gates had the same shape. The world is pinned here, in
 * one place, so the sixth gate inherits it instead of re-deciding it.
