/**
 * Which chunk a service-layer module belongs in.
 *
 * These directories are kept whole because their barrels cycle (see the
 * comment in vite.config.ts). Keeping them whole used to mean ONE chunk, and
 * that chunk is on the landing page's critical path — so every service module
 * went with it, including the P2P messenger that the landing page never
 * statically reaches and main.tsx loads with a dynamic import after first
 * paint. Forcing it into the eager chunk undid that dynamic import.
 *
 * Splitting by static reachability keeps both properties: each half is still
 * whole, and no static edge can run from the eager half to the deferred one —
 * a module statically imported by a reachable module is reachable by
 * definition — so no chunk cycle can form between them.
