/**
 * Verifies the promise the app makes when it says "Citadel has been installed
 * and will now load without a connection".
 *
 * That claim can only be tested by actually running the thing: a service worker
 * has to register, activate and serve a navigation from cache. Static checks of
 * dist/ cannot reach it — check-pwa-installable.mjs owns those, including the
 * manifest and icons, and this deliberately does not repeat them. The split is
 * by cost: that one needs no browser and runs everywhere, this one needs a real
 * Chromium and runs where one is installed.
 *
 * Runs against `vite preview`, never the dev server: vite-plugin-pwa disables
 * the worker in development (devOptions.enabled: false) because one
 * intercepting requests makes HMR confusing to reason about. The dev server is
 * therefore the one place this can never be tested, which is why the PWA sits
 * outside the normal Playwright suite.
 *
 * Reuses the prebuilt dist/ that check-lighthouse.mjs also expects, so CI builds
 * once and every production-bundle check verifies the same artefact.
