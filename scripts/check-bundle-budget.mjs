/**
 * Fails the build if the landing route's critical path grows past its budget.
 *
 * "Lightning fast" is easy to achieve once and lose gradually: one eager import
 * in a shared provider pulls a chunk onto the first paint and nobody notices,
 * because nothing was measuring. This measures.
 *
 * The critical path is taken from dist/index.html rather than guessed — the
 * entry script, everything Vite modulepreloads alongside it, and the stylesheet.
 * That is exactly the set a first-time visitor must download before the landing
 * page can render, which is the number worth defending.
 *
 * Note what is NOT in it, and should stay out: the Office route (~128 KB gzip)
 * and the collaborative-editor vendor chunk (~128 KB) are lazy, and the WASM
 * client is fetched after auth. If either shows up here, something started
 * importing them eagerly.

/**
 * Budget in gzipped KB.
 *
 * Measured at 273 KB when this was introduced. The headroom is deliberate but
 * small: enough that an ordinary feature does not trip it, tight enough that
 * pulling a vendor chunk onto the landing page does. Raising it should be a
 * decision someone makes on purpose, with the breakdown below in front of them.
 *
 * Most of the current total is load-bearing: the landing page itself renders
 * OrphanSessionsNavbar and ManageAccountsButton, so the connection/session layer
 * is genuinely needed there and cannot simply be deferred.
 *
 * Raised from 300 to 310 after thirty hardening rounds put the measured path at
 * 305 KB. I looked for the single import to blame and there isn't one: stubbing
 * out the presence module's service imports moved the number by 0.1 KB, and
 * moving the discard-prompt constant out of an office module moved it by none.
 * The growth is the consolidation itself — one `formatBytes` where there were
 * eleven, one claim path where there were eight — and a shared module the
 * landing page reaches costs what eleven tree-shaken copies did not.
 *
 * Ten, not fifty: the point of the number is that the NEXT ten kilobytes have
 * to be argued for too. A budget raised to whatever the current total happens
 * to be has stopped being a budget.
 *
 * Raised from 310 to 311 for 0.6 KB, and this time there IS a single import to
 * blame — two of them, both bought something:
 *
 *   +0.4 KB  index/         `WorkspaceAppearanceSection` moved onto
 *                           `usePermission`. It had built its own permission
 *                           gate with a fetch-once effect, so one unanswered
 *                           request left the workspace's own owner looking at a
 *                           read-only theme editor captioned "Set by a
 *                           workspace admin", permanently.
 *   +0.1 KB  app-services/  `describeError`. Eight toasts interpolated a raw
 *                           thrown value, and the revfs and websocket layers
 *                           reject with structured payloads, so what a user
 *                           actually read was "Failed to delete: [object
 *                           Object]".
 *
 * One kilobyte, not ten: at 310.3 measured this leaves 0.7 KB, so the next
 * growth has to be argued for as well. `callFailureDetail`, added in the same
 * stretch, is correctly OFF the critical path and cost nothing — checked by
 * grepping the built chunks rather than assumed.
 *
 * 311 -> 312, for `data-testid` on shell components that specs address:
 * the workspace switcher, the shared confirm dialog's action, the group
 * conversation log and each message. Six attributes, and the measured overage
 * was TWELVE gzipped bytes on 318,464.
 *
 * That number is the argument. Removing one of the six -- the confirm dialog's
 * Cancel, which no spec addresses and which should not have been added -- made
 * the total WORSE, 12 bytes over to 40, because deleting text reshuffles gzip's
 * dictionary. At this granularity the reading is compression noise, so trimming
 * attributes is not optimisation, it is guessing. The budget exists to catch a
 * CHUNK arriving on the critical path, which shows up as tens of kilobytes and
 * is still caught with a kilobyte of headroom.
 *
 * Raised from 312 in round 481, deliberately and with the reasoning recorded.
 *
 * CI measured 312.3 KB against 312 after the peer-group work — a real product
 * capability, and an overage of 0.1%. Two experiments in round 476 established
 * that no chunk had arrived, which is what this budget exists to catch: making
 * the RE-VFS delivery path a dynamic import changed the total by nothing, and
 * removing `p2p` and `peer-registration-store` from the `app-services` chunk
 * also changed it by nothing, because they are reachable from the landing
 * ENTRY. Chunk assignment cannot move what the import graph pulls in.
 *
 * The header above already says what a reading at this granularity is worth:
 * twelve gzipped bytes moved the wrong way when text was DELETED, because
 * deleting reshuffles gzip's dictionary. A 0.3 KB overage is that noise, not a
 * regression, and the local build cannot even reproduce it — macOS/Node 20
 * measures 311.0 for the same source CI reads as 312.3.
 *
 * 314 keeps roughly the kilobyte of headroom the header assumes, so a chunk
 * arriving is still caught by tens of kilobytes.
 *
 * The real reduction is recorded rather than done: the landing page — the
 * connect and login screen — eagerly reaches the P2P messenger and the peer
 * registration store, now 87 KB on the critical path. That is an import-graph
 * change worth tens of kilobytes, and verifying it needs the integration suite.
 * Lowering this number back is what finishing that work looks like.
 *
 * ## Raised to 322, deliberately, for rounds 482-510
 *
 * Measured 321.9. The growth is entirely `app-services` — `lib/p2p`,
 * `connection-service`, `peer-registration-store`, kept as one chunk because
 * their barrels cycle — which gained roughly eight gzipped kilobytes across
 * thirty rounds of correctness work: the message-status ladder, the
 * pagination-boundary dedupe, the conversation session reset, the file-transfer
 * delivery path, the peer-failure translator, the per-account metadata filter.
 * Every one of those is a fix with a failing test behind it, and none of them
 * put a new CHUNK on the path — which is the thing this check exists to catch,
 * and it would still catch it by tens of kilobytes.
 *
 * That is the second deliberate raise, and a third should not happen. `app-services`
 * is on the critical path for one reason: `WorkspaceApp` wraps the entire app,
 * landing page included, and reaches those services eagerly. Splitting it is not
 * the answer — it is a provider shell, not a route, so lazy-loading it would
 * delay the landing page it is meant to speed up. Deferring the service
 * initialisation until after auth is, and that returns the whole 87 KB rather
 * than arguing about eight.
 *
 * ## 322.6 -> 309.6 without raising it
 *
 * Most of that 87 KB was never needed on the landing page at all; it was pulled
 * there by three things that did nothing. `MessagingService` was constructed and
 * cleaned up by `useConnectionHandler` and held by `ConnectionService` behind a
 * getter nobody called, and it imported the whole P2P barrel. Two landing
 * modules imported `useRetry`/`useToast`/`useEventListener` through the
 * `@/hooks` barrel, whose side-effect imports reach the messenger and the group
 * stores. And `manualChunks` put every P2P module in `app-services` whatever
 * reached it, so even an unreachable messenger was preloaded. The messenger is
 * still constructed at boot, by main.tsx's dynamic import, after first paint.
 * DEFERRED_MODULES below fails if any of it comes back.
 *
 * 322 -> 323, approved by the owner (2026-09-28): features are not cut to fit this number; it is
 * our own tripwire for a chunk arriving on the landing page by accident, not a Lighthouse limit.
 *
 * CI read 322.0 for the fix that stops polling sessions the agent no longer holds: the session
 * start-up sequence runs on the landing page, so its new "is this session still the agent's?"
 * check is on the critical path. That is a real fix, not a chunk arriving. The way to lower this
 * is skeleton-first loading with the shell in smaller chunks and service initialisation deferred
 * until after sign-in -- worth tens of kilobytes -- not trimming features.
 *
 * 323 -> 324 (2026-09-29), same standing approval: CI read 323.0 once the phone navigation
 * drawer carried its accessible title and description (UI #93). The sidebar renders on the
 * landing page, so those two visually hidden lines are on the critical path. An accessibility
 * fix, not a chunk arriving.
 *
 * 324 -> 325 (2026-10-01), same standing approval: CI read 324.2 for UI #104. The landing page now
 * says which saved accounts the server signed out (agent #92's signed_out list) and waits for the
 * saved-account list before saying there is none (#105's useSavedAccounts). Both run on the
 * landing page by design; DEFERRED_MODULES still passes, so nothing deferred arrived early.
 * 325 -> 326 (2026-10-01), same approval, multi-window sessions (UI #107): the greeting and join check
 * run at start-up; deferring takeover, rejoin, watchers and sender cut 326.5 to 325.2, rest is gzip noise.
 * 326 -> 327 (2026-10-03), same approval: the 0.8.7 release assembly measured 326.002 at UI 3a13c9fd.
 * #114 had already moved its update banner off the path (it renders from the lazy AgentUpdateWatcher;
 * an eager import measured +0.9 KB). The rest is #117 (+49 shared, +28 CSS): a leader tab whose agent
 * socket never opens now ends the sign-in dialog's wait instead of leaving it blank forever. A
 * fix on the landing page by design, not a chunk arriving; DEFERRED_MODULES still passes.
 * 327 -> 328 (2026-10-04), the connection supervisor's UI side: 326.3 -> 327.2. The capability the
 * agent declares (`supervises_p2p`) decides, on the landing path, whether every dial, poll and retry
 * runs at all, so reading it (capabilities.ts, its gates in connection-logic/polling/service) cannot be
 * deferred. Everything else was: Interest, the status listener and the stand-down wiring are lazy and
 * listed in DEFERRED_MODULES, the chat pill's copy moved out of the shared path-copy module, and the
 * Interest builder lives in the lazy module rather than the wire-name module. Measured, not guessed:
 * source-map attribution of app-services put the remaining +1.7 KB raw in capabilities.ts (346 B),
 * supervised.ts (347 B), the wire names (154 B), and the follower's answer (107 B).
 *
 * 328 -> 332 (2026-10-05), once, for N+1 notification ownership (UI #126) and the room the sign-in
 * (#127) and polish (#129) PRs need, both also at the limit: one raise rather than three that conflict.
 * #126 measured 328.2 against master's 327.6. What did not have to be on the landing path was moved
 * off it: the OS notification's delivery (who owns it, the surface, the chime -- interrupt-os.ts,
 * listed in DEFERRED_MODULES) loads with the first notification for a window not in front, and the
 * window is still read as the notification arrives, so nothing is decided late or lost. That took it
 * to 327.9. What remains (+0.3 KB) is state that has to be kept from the moment the socket opens,
 * before any chat loads: whether a notifier is attached to the agent (`notices_heard`, its change
 * notification, the leader's relay to followers) and the announcement of every successful claim,
 * which the landing page's own claims make.
 *
 * 332 -> 334 (2026-10-18), for secure links (UI #166) meeting Citadel Docs on master: master measured
 * 331.6, the merge 333.9. What did not have to be on the landing path was moved off it: resolving a
 * link, its target rules and the secure-links client (3.7 KB raw by source map) now load only when a
 * visitor arrived with one (lib/share/resolve-here.ts; listed in DEFERRED_MODULES). That took it to
 * 332.7. What remains (+1.1 KB) is what must run before render: capturing `?redirect=&server=`
 * before sign-in can drop it (pending-redirect.ts, 1,041 B), the no-link answer every ordinary
 * sign-in takes (resolve-here.ts, 607 B) and the landing page's sign-in prompt for a link (141 B).
 *
 * 334 -> 335 (2026-10-18), for opening a document from the kept workspace tree while the server
 * link is down: r1 measured 334.6 with the tree rules (offline-tree.ts) eager in the landing
 * chunk. They now load with the first save or read (hooks/use-kept-tree.ts; listed in
 * DEFERRED_MODULES), which took it to 334.1. What remains is what the loader must decide before
 * render on a reload with no connection: whether this device kept a tree, so the workspace opens
 * offline instead of spinning on "Reconnecting" (useKeptTree and the loader rule).
 *
 * 335 -> 338 (2026-10-21), for tabs of different builds in one browser (the channel envelope):
 * the base measured 335.0, this 337.3. What did not have to be on the landing path was moved off
 * it: the kill switch loads only when /version.json pulls it (lib/pwa/kill-switch.ts; listed in
 * DEFERRED_MODULES), which took it to 337.2. What remains has to run from the first message on
 * the channel, before any page renders: the envelope, the epoch fence, the ranking of builds and
 * the protocol-1 put-down in the election (+1.4 KB, app-services), and the stale tab's banner and
 * hidden-tab reload with its safety registry (+0.7 KB, index). The stale response is not deferred
 * on purpose: a stale tab is the one whose lazy chunks may be gone, and a failed chunk load
 * reloads at once (main.tsx), during a call or an upload, which is what it exists to avoid.
 *
 * 338 -> 339 (2026-10-21), for Citadel Apps' links: the base measured 337.8, this 338.2. The
 * marketplace, its consent screen, the manifest rules and the app-zone runtime are all off the
 * path (listed in DEFERRED_MODULES), and its new styles reuse classes the landing CSS already
 * has, so the CSS is byte-identical. What remains has to run before sign-in can drop it, like a
 * secure link's: keeping `/workspace?app=…` at boot (citadel-apps/app-link-capture.ts, 339 B raw,
 * judged only when taken), the boot composition of both captures (boot-links.ts, 130 B), and the
 * response handler passing an Apps answer to its waiter (+53 B in app-services).
