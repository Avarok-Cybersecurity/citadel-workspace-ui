       * nominal value and `text-xs` lands at 10.5px. Lighthouse measured 44.85%
       * of the landing page's text as illegible, and 228 elements use this
       * class, so that is not a corner of the design: it is most of the small
       * print in the product, below the size at which small print is readable.
       *
       * `max()` rather than a fixed 12px, because the point of the setting is
       * that it scales. At a 16px root this is exactly 12px as before; at 18px
       * it grows to 13.5px; at the 12px minimum the floor holds instead of
       * dropping to 9px. Only the illegible direction is clamped.
