/**
 * A button with no handler is a promise the app does not keep.
 *
 * This has now been the finding twice in the same component: round 131 found
 * both Invite buttons in the user directory rendered with no `onClick`, and the
 * fix was applied to those two and not to "Remove Connection" in the connected
 * branch of the same card — a destructive-looking control that did nothing,
 * which teaches the user that disconnecting is broken.
 *
 * A control that operates on nothing is worse than a missing one: the user
 * clicks, nothing happens, and they cannot tell that from a failure.
 *
 * The scan is textual and therefore conservative — it asks only whether a
 * `<Button>` opening tag carries something that could make it act. Anything
 * that does is accepted, because the alternative is a rule people route around.
