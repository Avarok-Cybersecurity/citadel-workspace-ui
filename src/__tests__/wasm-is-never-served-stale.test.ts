/**
 * wasm-bindgen glue JS and its .wasm binary are coupled through export tables
 * and closure-shim indices. Serve one generation's glue against another's
 * binary and every internal-service call silently no-ops — login and register
 * do nothing, with no message and no server-side log line.
 *
 * The glue lives in hashed app chunks, which the precache versions atomically.
 * So the binary's caching decides whether the pair matches, and this repo has
 * now shipped every wrong answer to that question:
 *
 *   CacheFirst              old binary, new glue, for up to thirty days
 *   StaleWhileRevalidate    the very reload applying an update pairs new glue
 *                           with the previous binary
 *   NetworkFirst            with registerType 'prompt', the OLD worker keeps
 *                           serving OLD glue while the network hands it the NEW
 *                           binary — so every launch between a deploy and the
 *                           user clicking Reload runs a mismatched pair, and
 *                           the mismatched binary poisons the cache for offline
 *                           starts too
 *
 * Each fix corrected the previous direction and opened another, because all
 * three answer from a generation independent of the precache. The binary is now
 * precached WITH the glue, so both halves are revisioned by the same worker and
 * there is no window in which a page holds one of each.
 *
 * This reads the real vite config rather than a copy of the rule.
