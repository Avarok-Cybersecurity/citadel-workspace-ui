/**
 * Every place that handles Enter itself has to suppress it during IME
 * composition — and this is exactly the kind of rule that gets written once and
 * never propagated.
 *
 * It was: the chat composer carried the `isComposing` check and said so in a
 * comment, while the rename input, the path bar, the document-title modal and
 * the hex field each handled Enter themselves and each went without. A user
 * typing Japanese, Chinese or Korean committed a half-composed value every time
 * they chose a character.
 *
 * This scan is the thing that keeps the fix propagated. A new `key === 'Enter'`
 * either routes through the shared rule or names itself here with a reason.
