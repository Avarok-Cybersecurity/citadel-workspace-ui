/**
 * A catch that reports a fixed sentence throws away what the server said.
 *
 * This has now been the finding four separate times — the node delete path, the
 * admin member writes, the entity create/edit modal, and the add-peer form. In
 * each, `awaitWriteResponse` (or the transport) produced a precise rejection —
 * "Permission denied: EditTreeStructure required", "Cannot demote the only
 * administrator" — and the catch replaced it with "Please try again", sending
 * the real one to `debugLog`, which is compiled out of production builds.
 *
 * The user then cannot tell "you are not allowed to do this" from "the network
 * blipped", so they retry something that can never work.
 *
 * This scan is the fifth fix, and the last one: a catch that surfaces a message
 * to the user has to consult the error it caught, or say here why it does not.
