/**
 * Anything with an onClick must be operable without a mouse.
 *
 * A `<div onClick>` with no role, no `tabIndex` and no key handler is invisible
 * to a keyboard and announces nothing to a screen reader. axe catches some of
 * these and not others, and the keyboard-reachability check in
 * `check-accessibility.mjs` cannot see them at all: they are not in its selector
 * list, because they are not buttons, links or form fields. That is the same
 * gap round 215 found for the slider thumb — the instrument decides what exists.
 *
 * The tree is clean today, so this is a lock rather than a repair.
