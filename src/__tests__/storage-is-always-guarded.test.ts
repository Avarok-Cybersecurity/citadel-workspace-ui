/**
 * No module may touch `sessionStorage` directly.
 *
 * The accessor throws outright under strict privacy settings, enterprise policy
 * and some embedded contexts — it does not return null, it raises a
 * `SecurityError`. Several callers here run during boot, and unguarded the app
 * did not mount, did not reach the root error boundary, and rendered an **empty
 * body**. A blank page is worse than a crash screen: there is nothing on screen
 * to report and nothing in the UI to act on.
 *
 * `localStorage` was wrapped at every site in this codebase. Its sibling was
 * wrapped at none — the same one-of-two shape this campaign keeps finding.
 *
 * The guard is a rule rather than six try/catch blocks, so the next caller
 * inherits it instead of re-deciding it.
