/**
 * A query key that nothing observes does not survive five minutes.
 *
 * React Query garbage-collects a cache entry once it has no observers, after
 * the default five-minute gcTime. `setQueryData` alone does not create one —
 * only a `useQuery`/`useQueries` on that key does. So a value written with
 * `setQueryData` and read back with `getQueryData`, with no hook between them,
 * is a value that silently becomes `undefined` if the user is slow.
 *
 * The registration flow did exactly this with the user's chosen security
 * settings: raise your security level, spend five minutes on the profile step
 * with a password manager, and the account is created with the DEFAULTS —
 * permanently, with nothing said. Landing had already lifted the server address
 * out of the cache for this reason, and the fix was not carried across.
 *
 * The fallback is what hides it. `getQueryData(...) || defaults` reads as
 * "settings, or sensible defaults" and behaves as "settings, until the timer".
