/**
 * No stylesheet rule may set text below the 12px legibility floor.
 *
 * Lighthouse measured 44.85% of the landing page as illegible and named
 * `.text-xs` at 10.5px — Tailwind's `0.75rem` against a 14px document root
 * (round 185). That was a Tailwind-scale problem and was fixed there.
 *
 * `index.css` had five more, written as flat pixels, which Lighthouse never saw
 * because they live on collaborative-editor surfaces rather than the landing
 * page: a collaborator's name in a cursor tooltip at 11px, a comment's author
 * at 11px, its timestamp at 10px.
 *
 * Absolute sizes are worse than the Tailwind case in one respect. `text-xs`
 * at least grows when the user raises the font-size setting; a flat 10px does
 * not, so someone who set the app to 18px because they could not read it still
 * got a 10px timestamp.
 *
 * Hierarchy below 12px is not hierarchy. It is two sizes of unreadable, and
 * weight and colour carry the distinction without costing legibility.
