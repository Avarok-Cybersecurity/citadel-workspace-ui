/**
 * `aria-pressed` carries the state, so the accessible name must not also flip

 *
 * The mute button was `aria-label={media.audio ? 'Mute microphone' : 'Unmute
 * microphone'}` with `aria-pressed={media.audio}`. Announced: "Mute
 * microphone, toggle button, pressed" — which a listener reads as *muted*,
 * while the microphone was in fact live. On a privacy control that is the worst
 * possible direction to be wrong in.
