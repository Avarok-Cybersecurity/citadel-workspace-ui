/**
 * Two defects in `citadel-workspace-client-ts` that fire in the one code path
 * this app actually uses.
 *
 * `WorkspaceSessionManager`'s constructor called `client.setErrorHandler(...)`,
 * which overwrites the single handler slot — so the `errorHandler` this app
 * passes in its config (`lib/websocket/initialization.ts`) was silently
 * discarded before the first error ever arrived. And the reconnect it installed
 * in place of it was a stub: it logged "Reconnection would require stored
 * credentials" and then CLEARED the workspace session, on the success path,
 * unconditionally. So any WASM-layer error — including a routine
 * message-processing error — threw the user out of their workspace, while the
 * base client had a real `restart_ws_connection` it never called.
 *
 * Asserted against the library's source. That package has no test harness of its
 * own, and adding one is a larger change than these two fixes; a source guard
 * cannot prove the behaviour is right, but it does prevent this exact pair
 * coming back, and it says which line to look at when it fails.
