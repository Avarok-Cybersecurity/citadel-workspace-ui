/**
 * An exported function that nothing refers to is the shape this campaign keeps
 * finding, and it is cheap to detect.
 *
 * Not a style complaint. Every instance so far has been a feature wired from
 * one end: `refresh()` that no component called, so the group list never
 * reconciled with the server. `initPrivacySettingsSync`, so a privacy choice
 * made in one tab never reached the others. A second leader election. A
 * submodule guard that was correct and ran nowhere. In each case the code was
 * written, reviewed and merged, and the only thing missing was a caller.
 *
 * A ratchet rather than a clean sweep. Thirty-eight names are recorded in
 * `unreferenced-exports.baseline.json` as of this commit — some are genuinely
 * dead, some are half-built features worth finishing, and deciding which is
 * which is a change per entry, not one commit. What the ratchet buys
 * immediately is that the list cannot grow: a new unreferenced export fails
 * here, in the commit that adds it, while the author still knows what it was
 * for.
 *
 * The list must also SHRINK honestly. A name that has since gained a caller is
 * an error too, because a stale baseline is how a ratchet quietly stops
 * ratcheting.
