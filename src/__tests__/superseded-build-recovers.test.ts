/**
 * A window whose chunks were replaced underneath it must recover on its own.
 *
 * `skipWaiting` takes over EVERY client at once, so the moment one window
 * accepts an update the new precache is active everywhere — and the old hashed
 * chunks are gone from it and 404 from nginx, which serves only the current
 * build. Every route in this app is lazy, so any other open window that then
 * navigates somewhere it had not already visited fails its dynamic import.
 *
 * With nothing listening, that rejection reaches the top-level error boundary
 * and replaces the whole app, for a user who did nothing but have a second tab
 * open. Multi-tab is first-class here — the leader/follower architecture assumes
 * it.
 *
 * Asserted on the source, because the handler is registered at module scope in
 * the app's entry point, which cannot be imported in a test without booting the
 * whole application.
