/**
 * Every subscriber to a member list says which domain's list it wants.
 *
 * The workspace protocol carries no request id, so a `Members` response cannot
 * be attributed to the request that caused it. `is-for-domain.ts` was written
 * for four subscribers taking last-writer-wins — the sidebar, the admin members
 * tab, the user-search corpus and the group-call roster — and was applied to
 * two of them.
 *
 * The group-call roster was the sharpest miss, and its own header said so in
 * the wrong direction: "the event carries no domain id, so this is the
 * established contract, not an oversight of this hook". True when written,
 * false once the filter landed. Meanwhile another entity's ListMembers response
 * replaced the callable roster, so Start call rang THAT domain's members and
 * dropped this one's.
 *
 * A subscriber that genuinely wants every list has to say so here.
