/**
 * Nothing real may consult the demo simulator's store.
 *
 * `lib/connection-service` mixes one live duty — connection-status fan-out —
 * with a simulated P2P pipeline: handlers that fabricate responses on a
 * `setTimeout`, a module that raises fake notifications, and a connection map
 * keyed on the literal `'current-user'`. The only writer of that map is
 * `acceptConnectionRequest`, which nothing outside the demo calls.
 *
 * So every read of it answers the same thing forever, and the reads looked
 * like real service calls. Two shipped: the green dot in user search (which
 * had previously been `Math.random()`, so the "fix" swapped a random lie for a
 * constant one), and a send gate that could never pass, sitting in front of a
 * method with no callers, waiting for someone to wire it up.
 *
 * Presence and connectivity both have real sources — the polled peer registry.
 * This keeps the demo store from being mistaken for one again.
