/**
 * There is one place that claims a session, and it checks for another tab.
 *
 * "Not orphaned" from the agent means somebody has this session, and that
 * somebody may be another tab in this browser. Adopting it anyway lets two tabs
 * register the same CID, after which `findInstanceByCid` returns the first map
 * hit and every CID-routed notification — messages, transfer ticks, call media
 * — goes to one tab while the other renders the same conversation and silently
 * never updates.
 *
 * Round 153 fixed that in the auto-claim path. It reached one site of FOUR: the
 * workspace switcher, the orphan-sessions navbar and the post-login redirect
 * all still swallowed the refusal and adopted, so the defect stayed reachable
 * through three unfixed doors. This is that lesson made mechanical.
