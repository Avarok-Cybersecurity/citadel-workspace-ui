/**
 * Whether a workspace member is actually online.
 *
 * This dot has now been wrong four times, each in a different way:
 *
 *   1. `Math.random() > 0.5` — a coin flip contradicting the same user's
 *      status elsewhere on every render.
 *   2. `connectionService.canMessageUser` — a map keyed on the literal
 *      'current-user' that only the demo simulation writes, so constant false
 *      for everyone while naming a service that sounds authoritative.
 *   3. This module's first version — which asked the peer registry for a CID,
 *      having assumed member ids ARE CIDs. They are usernames: the kernel sets
 *      `user_id = get_username_by_cid(...)` and `ListMembers` returns those
 *      verbatim. The numeric guard rejected every real id, so it went straight
 *      back to constant false. A comment in this file asserted the wrong thing
 *      confidently, which is how the assumption survived review.
 *   4. `UserDirectory` ignoring all of the above and rendering "is registered
 *      with me" under a green dot — so a registered peer who is offline showed
 *      as online.
 *   5. Upstream of all of it: `Peer.isOnline` was a plain boolean, and the
 *      registry INVENTED `true` for a peer the agent had said nothing about.
 *      This function ORs that flag with the live poll, so the invention
 *      outranked the real answer. The field is now `boolean | null`, and this
 *      function returns null for the same reason: not knowing is a third
 *      answer, and the two it used to be squeezed into are both assertions.
 *
 * A member id is a USERNAME. The peer registry indexes peers by CID and carries
 * both the username and the real `isOnline` the agent reports, so the lookup is
 * by username, and the answer comes from the same set the sidebar's peer list
 * uses.
 *
 * A numeric id is still accepted, because nothing forbids a numeric username
 * and treating one as unknown would be a fifth version of the same bug.
