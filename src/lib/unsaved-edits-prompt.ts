/**
 * What to ask before discarding an editor buffer.
 *
 * A plain constant, in a leaf module. It lived in `use-unsaved-mdx-guard`, so
 * every navigation source that wanted to ask the question had to import an
 * OFFICE module to get it — and `leave-editor`, which the sidebar imports,
 * dragged that graph towards the landing critical path. The bundle-budget gate
 * names this shape exactly: "an eager import in a shared provider is the usual
 * cause".
