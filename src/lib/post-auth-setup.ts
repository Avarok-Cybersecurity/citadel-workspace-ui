  // follower tabs. Setting it here also triggers the cid-update broadcast so

  // written once when the session was created and never refreshed. The server is
  // the authority: it promotes the first account to Admin on connect, and the
  // client never heard about it. Measured in CI, from the server's own log:
  //
  //   [ASYNC_KERNEL] User pw_admin_… is the first workspace member; promoted to Admin
  //
  // while the browser showed no ADMIN SETTINGS section, global-setup concluded
  // "a workspace already existed; this account is a member", and every spec
  // needing edit rights skipped or failed behind that.
  //
  // The machinery to correct it already existed: `members:loaded` finds this
  // user in the list, updates the role and persists it to the stored session.
  // Nothing asked for the list at boot -- it was requested only when the members
  // panel was opened, so an administrator who never opened that panel was shown
  // a member's app.
