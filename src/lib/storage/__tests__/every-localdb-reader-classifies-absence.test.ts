/**
 * Every module that reads LocalDB and catches must tell absent from failed.
 *
 * `sendLocalDBGet` rejects for BOTH "no such key" and "the socket is down". A
 * catch that treats them alike returns the same answer for "nothing is stored"
 * and "I could not find out" — and upstream, those answers mean very different
 * things:
 *
 *  - no stored sessions → the reconnect machinery sends the user to the landing
 *    page. A failed read does that to somebody with a live session.
 *  - no such document → reported as "this document does not exist".
 *  - default preference → silently turns auto-connect back on for somebody who
 *    turned it off.
 *
 * Round 265 unified the PREDICATE and added a test refusing a fifth copy of the
 * string. That guard could not see this: `connection/session-management` never
 * tested the string at all — it caught everything into one line — so nothing
 * flagged it, and CI printed
 *
 *   [ConnectionService] Failed to load stored sessions Error: Key not found
 *
 * on every boot for weeks. A guard against copies of a fix is not a guard
 * against the absence of one.
 *
 * The allow-list is the point: a module lands on it by somebody deciding it
 * belongs there and writing down why, not by nobody noticing.
