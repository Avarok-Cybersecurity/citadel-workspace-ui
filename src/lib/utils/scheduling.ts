 * every user pays the difference on every run. Both failure modes are silent.
 *
 * Prefer, in order:
 *   1. `await` the operation you actually depend on.
 *   2. `waitFor(...)` — proceed the instant a condition holds.
 *   3. `yieldToEventLoop()` — hand control back so the browser can paint.
 *   4. A real delay, only where an external constraint requires one (retry
 *      backoff against a remote service, a poll interval). Say which, in a comment.

 *
