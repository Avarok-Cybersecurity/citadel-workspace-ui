/**
 * Keeps the peer list reference-stable while it has not changed.
 *
 * `getPeers()` built its arrays with `Array.from` on every call, so the result
 * was never reference-equal to the previous one and no caller could ever bail
 * out of a re-render. `useFileManagerContent` polls it every 2 seconds forever
 * and feeds the result straight to `setState`, so an idle file manager
 * re-rendered its whole tree and grid -- every tile carrying a Radix
 * ContextMenu root -- in a 2-second sawtooth for as long as the tab stayed
 * open.
 *
 * Fixed here, at the shared source, rather than at that one caller: the
 * identity is `getPeers()`'s contract, and every other consumer had the same
 * trap waiting.
 *
 * WHY ELEMENT COMPARISON RATHER THAN A DIRTY FLAG. The service hands both peer
 * maps to helper modules by reference, so a flag maintained by the class alone
 * would go stale the moment one of them mutated a map directly -- and a stale
 * "unchanged" here means the UI silently stops updating, which is far worse
 * than the re-render being fixed. The peer count is small; the cost of being
 * right is a loop over it.
 *
 * Its own module so it can be tested without importing the service singleton,
 * whose module graph pulls in the websocket layer and cannot be constructed
 * under vitest.
