/**
 * "A window wants this peer connected": the supervised replacement for dialling.
 *
 * An open chat or a call sends Interest to the agent, which decides whether,
 * when and how to dial. The window never waits on the outcome: the request is
 * sent without an answer to wait for, and a failure to send is logged, not
 * thrown, so "Send" is never held up by it. Interest expires on its own at
 * `until`, so a window that closes (or a tab that dies) needs no goodbye; a
 * window that stays renews it at half the lifetime.
