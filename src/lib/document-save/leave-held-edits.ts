/**
 * Asking before a sign-out deletes edits that exist only on this device. Signing out removes

 * still held after that (or with no way to send it) is deleted only on an explicit yes.
 *
 * The one seam for that decision (an owner choice still open): the callers ask
 * `mayLeaveHeldEdits` and act on its answer; the wording is leave-held-edits-prompt.ts.
