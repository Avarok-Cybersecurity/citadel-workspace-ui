/**
 * A deadline for a loading flag.
 *
 * These flags are raised when a request is SENT and lowered when its event
 * arrives — `WorkspaceService.listX()` resolves on send, not on response. If the
 * response never comes (socket drop, a server that answered Error, a dropped
 * frame) the flag stays raised and the surface spins forever.
 *
 * The honest fallback is the empty state: after the deadline we stop claiming to
 * be loading, so the UI says "nothing here" — which is at least a statement the
 * user can act on — rather than a spinner that will never resolve.
 *
 * Raising the flag at all is the fix for the opposite failure: the flags had no
 * writer, so every list rendered its empty state as fact while data was in
 * flight. This module exists so fixing that one does not introduce this one.
