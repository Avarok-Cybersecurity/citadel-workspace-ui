/**
 * Knowing one peer is online says nothing about anybody else.
 *
 * `peerOnlineStatus` returns `null` until a poll has landed, so the sidebar can
 * say "not known" instead of writing "Offline" beside someone who is sitting
 * right there. That guard is only as good as its definition of "a poll has
 * landed" — and `addOnlinePeer` used to rebuild the whole list and call
 * `setOnlinePeers`, which stamps the timestamp.
 *
 * So one registration event dated an incrementally-built set as though the
 * backend had answered. Follower tabs never poll at all — `startBackendPolling`
 * returns early when the tab is not leader — so after a single registration
 * they answered a confident `false` for every peer they had not personally
 * added. That is the exact sentence the third state exists to prevent, restored
 * by the write that was supposed to be harmless.
 *
 * This is the reachability lens from round 399 pointed the other way: there the
 * settled state was unreachable, here it was reachable without ever being
 * earned.
