/**
 * RE-VFS byte-key reference counting (pure).
 *
 * A copy made with `copyNode` gets a fresh `fileId` but SHARES the original's
 * `fileMetadata.virtualDirectory` — the immutable upload-time key the backend
 * stores the bytes under. The backend has send / download / delete and no way
 * to duplicate or re-path an object, and the browser does not hold the bytes
 * (peer- and server-scoped files live on the remote node), so a copy cannot
 * re-upload under its own key: sharing is the only representable relationship.
 *
 * That sharing made deletion destructive: removing EITHER copy issued a
 * backend delete for the shared key, destroying the bytes the surviving node
 * still pointed at — and an rmdir sweeping a folder that contained only a
 * copy destroyed bytes referenced from outside the folder entirely.
 *
 * Delete sites therefore consult this count and only issue the backend delete
 * when the node being removed is the LAST reference to its byte key.
 */
