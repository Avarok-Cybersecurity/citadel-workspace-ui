/**
 * Two remote operations arriving together must not overwrite each other.
 *
 * `handleRevfsOperation` awaits the tree, applies the remote op to what it read,
 * and writes that back. `getTree` is `async`, so it yields even on the cached
 * path — and TWO operations arriving together therefore both read the tree
 * before either writes. The second applies its op to a snapshot taken before
 * the first one's write, and `setTree` puts that snapshot back: the first
 * operation is gone from memory, persisted over on disk, and repainted,
 * because `setTree` notifies.
 *
 * A first version of this test drove a LOCAL write during the load instead, and
 * passed with the fix reverted — `getTree` already re-checks after its own
 * await, so that window is covered and the test could not fail. Two concurrent
 * REMOTE operations is the window that is not.
 *
 * CI measured it as a file that appeared and then vanished:
 *
 *   File visible: true
 *   Attempt 1: File visible: false, expected visible: retry...
 *   Final result: File visible: false, expected visible: FAIL
 *
 * A merge is not the fix. This is the path that carries RemoveFile and Rmdir,
 * and `mergeTrees` is union-only by design, so merging would undo every remote
 * deletion. Applying to the freshest tree is.
