/**
 * A RE-VFS download must recognise the events a REVFS pull actually emits.
 *
 * It used to wait on `FileTransferStatusNotification`, which the internal
 * service emits from exactly ONE place — `respond_file_transfer.rs`, the
 * accept/decline flow for STANDARD transfers. A REVFS pull auto-accepts and
 * streams `FileTransferTickNotification` instead, so the success branch was
 * unreachable: every download timed out after 30s, resolved `success: false`,
 * and the caller — which checked only `result.type` — returned `undefined`.
 * The UI read that as "Download initiated for X".
 *
 * It also read `status.response?.download_path`, where `response` is a plain
 * bool on the wire, so even an impossible match would have yielded undefined.
 *
 * And it correlated on `status.cid === cid`, matching ANY transfer notification
 * for the session, so a concurrent standard transfer settled an unrelated
 * pending download.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE BELOW IS A CONTRACT, NOT A CONVENIENCE. Ticks addressed to the
 * browser's request_id only exist because the internal service threads it
 * through: the SDK's PullObject cannot carry a request id, so the kernel
 * registers it per-session in `kernel/revfs_correlation.rs` (written by
 * `requests/file/download.rs`, consumed by
 * `responses/object_transfer_handle.rs` when the pull's Receiver handle
 * arrives). Before that registry existed, real ticks carried the TCP
 * connection uuid — this suite's fabricated matching ticks passed while every
 * real download failed on timeout. If the kernel ever stops stamping pull
 * ticks with the DownloadFile request_id, this suite will keep passing and
 * the product will break: the seam is Rust-side, verify it there.
