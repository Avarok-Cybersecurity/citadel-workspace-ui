/**
 * A RE-VFS upload must not report success until the bytes have actually been
 * accepted by the node that stores them.
 *
 * `backendSendFile` used to resolve on `SendFileRequestSuccess`, which the
 * internal service emits the moment `remote.send(...)` QUEUES the SendObject —
 * before the receiving side has seen, let alone accepted, anything. A
 * peer-scoped REVFS push then arrived at the peer's internal service as a
 * transfer waiting for an explicit accept that nothing ever issued, so no
 * bytes were streamed — while the uploader, told "success", placed the node,
 * persisted the tree, and synced the op to the peer. Both trees listed a
 * "downloadable" file whose bytes existed nowhere.
 *
 * The honest terminal signal is the Sender-side `TransferComplete` tick: the
 * receiver only acks the file header AFTER accepting, and TransferComplete
 * only fires once every chunk has been streamed and acknowledged. Like the
 * download suite, the fixture ticks addressed to the browser's request_id are
 * a CONTRACT with the kernel: `requests/file/upload.rs` registers the
 * SendFile request_id in `kernel/revfs_correlation.rs` for REVFS pushes and
 * `responses/object_transfer_handle.rs` stamps the Sender tick stream with it.
 * (The peer-side acceptance itself is kernel-side too: the receiving internal
 * service auto-accepts REVFS pushes the way the server kernel always has.)
