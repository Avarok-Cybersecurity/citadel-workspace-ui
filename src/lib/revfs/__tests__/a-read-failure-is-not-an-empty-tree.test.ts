/**
 * A tree that could not be READ is not an empty tree.
 *
 * `OpfsStorage.readFile` caught every error and returned null, so a revoked
 * handle, a quota error, a locked file or any transient `NotReadableError` was
 * indistinguishable from a first run. `loadTree` returned null, and
 * `RevfsService.getTree` then built a default tree, cached it and PERSISTED it
 * -- over a tree that was still on disk. One transient read error destroyed the
 * user's files, silently, and the UI repainted as if they had never existed.
 *
 * Storage now reports the two cases apart. These tests pin both: the absent
 * case must still seed and persist a default (or nobody can ever start), and
 * the unreadable case must persist nothing.
