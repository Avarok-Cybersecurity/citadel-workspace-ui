/**
 * A file deleted locally came back through a sync, pointing at bytes that were
 * already destroyed.
 *
 * `mergeTrees` is a UNION merge, deliberately: this file's own note says
 * deletions are carried by explicit RemoveFile/RemoveDir operations and never
 * inferred from a missing child, because "never had it" and "deleted it" are
 * indistinguishable in a tree.
 *
 * But a local deletion is not instantaneous on the peer's side. `removeFile`
 * destroys the bytes, removes the node, and QUEUES a RemoveFile op; until the
 * peer applies and acks it, the peer's tree still holds the file. A SyncResponse
 * arriving in that window merges the peer's copy back in — and the node it
 * restores names a `virtualDirectory` whose bytes are gone. The file reappears
 * in the manager, opens to nothing, and counts against the storage quota.
 *
 * The union rule is right; what it lacked was knowledge of what is deliberately
 * on its way out. A path with a removal still pending is not a path we are
 * missing.
