/**
 * The engine loads on demand, and never reaches an operation uninitialized.
 *
 * A static import of `@/lib/revfs` from either `lib/p2p/message-handler-routing`
 * or `useConnectionHandler` puts the whole sync engine on the landing page's
 * critical path -- 8.6 KB before first paint. Deferring one of the two achieved
 * nothing: Rollup moved the engine from `app-services` into the entry chunk,
 * which is just as eager. Both now go through `revfs-loader`.
 *
 * The size win is guarded by `check:bundle` in CI. What THIS file guards is the
 * correctness cost of the change: two dynamic imports could each get the engine,
 * but only one of them configures it, so the router must not be able to hand an
 * operation to a service whose `initialize` has not run.
