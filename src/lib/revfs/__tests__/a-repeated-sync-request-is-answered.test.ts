/**
 * A peer whose SyncResponse was lost asked again for ever and was told nothing.
 *
 * The duplicate guard re-acknowledges an operation it has already applied, for
 * the reason its own comment gives: "a receiver that has already applied it and
 * stays silent leaves that sender retrying for ever". SyncRequest was excluded —
 * an Ack is the wrong shape for a query — so it got the exact failure that
 * sentence describes.
 *
 * CI showed it plainly: the same op id arriving once a second for a whole test,
 * every one logged "already applied", every one answered with silence, while the
 * file being synced never appeared on the other side. `Peer Sees File: FAIL`.
 *
 * Answering every duplicate is not the fix either. That is the flood the dedupe
 * was added for — seven SyncRequests became a hundred handled, each answered
 * with a fresh 564-byte SyncResponse on the reliable channel, starving the
 * PlaceFile and Rmdir the user had actually asked for. So: answer again, at most
 * once per peer per interval.
