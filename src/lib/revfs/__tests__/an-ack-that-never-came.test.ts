/**
 * A timeout is not an acknowledgement.
 *
 * `sendAndAwaitAck` resolved `void` whether the peer answered or the fifteen
 * second budget ran out, so no caller could tell the two apart. Round 413's
 * diagnostic sat after that await and reported "acknowledged by peer" for both,
 * and CI duly showed an acknowledgement logged 15.000s after the send — for an
 * operation the peer never applied. The peer's own log records applying only
 * the Mkdir ops; the Rmdir and the PlaceFile never reached it.
 *
 * Queuing the op for retry on a timeout is right. Reporting success is not.
