/**
 * An operation from a peer, arriving while a local upload is in flight, was
 * erased when the upload finished.
 *
 * Every local mutator on `RevfsService` runs under `withSerialLock` on the
 * tree's key — the lock added after a bulk delete had each operation capture the
 * same base tree and the last write resurrect everything the others removed.
 * `handleRevfsOperation` takes no lock at all.
 *
 * `uploadFileToPeer` reads the tree, then awaits `backend-send-file`, then
 * applies `treePlaceFile` to what it read BEFORE that await and calls `setTree`.
 * The send is a real network transfer with a 30-second ceiling. Anything a peer
 * did in that window — a mkdir, a rename, a delete — applied to the live tree,
 * was persisted, was repainted, and was then overwritten by the upload's stale
 * snapshot. Locally gone; on the peer's side still present. Silent divergence.
 *
 * `concurrent-remote-ops-do-not-clobber.test.ts` records that an earlier attempt
 * to test this shape drove a local write during `getTree`'s own await and passed
 * with the fix reverted, because `getTree` re-checks after that await. This
 * window is a different one: the snapshot is held across the BACKEND SEND, which
 * nothing re-checks.
