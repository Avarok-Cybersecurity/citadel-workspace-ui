/**
 * The peer-storage round trip, asserted as a property rather than a label.
 *
 * `uploadFileToPeer` sends the bytes to the peer, and `downloadFileFromPeer`
 * pulls them back from the peer. So the uploader's own node must be in a state
 * the download path accepts, and the peer — who is holding an encrypted blob
 * they have no key for — must not be.
 *
 * This got inverted: the uploader was stamped Hosted, which `isDownloadableState`
 * rejects, so a user's own file became permanently un-openable and the UI told
 * them it was "Hosted for peer (encrypted, cannot open)". The peer was stamped
 * Remote and pulled from the uploader's node, where nothing had been stored, so
 * the file was retrievable by nobody. Six tests across the suite asserted the
 * two labels directly and so moved with the bug instead of catching it — hence
 * this one asserts what the user can DO.
