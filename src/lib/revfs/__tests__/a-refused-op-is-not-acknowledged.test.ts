/**
 * An operation the receiver refused was acknowledged as applied.
 *
 * `applyRemoteOp` returns the tree unchanged for every refusal — a missing
 * parent, a protected path, an occupied destination — with no signal that it
 * declined. The inbound handler acknowledged `success: true` regardless, so the
 * sender retired the operation from its retry queue for something that never
 * happened. Two trees, permanently divergent, both believing they were correct.
 *
 * And the mark: `isNewOperation` records the id at the TOP of the handler,
 * before any of the work. A refusal or a throw after that leaves it recorded as
 * handled, so the sender's redelivery takes the "already applied" path and is
 * answered with a success Ack for an operation that has never landed. The mark
 * has to be undone by anything that did not apply.
 *
 * The sender ignored the answer anyway. `registerAck` resolves with the peer's
 * `success` flag and both `sendAndAwaitAck` and `retryPendingOps` discarded it,
 * returning success for any resolution — the same failure their timeout branches
 * were written to prevent, arriving by a different route. Three halves of one
 * mechanism, each correct on its own and none connected to the next.
