/**
 * An operation is applied once, however many times it arrives.
 *
 * CI evidence, run 33304689050: Bob sent SEVEN `SyncRequest`s and Alice's
 * handler ran for ONE HUNDRED of them. Bob applied the same `Mkdir` twice,
 * 21ms apart, with one `op_id`. The reliable transport redelivers, and nothing
 * on this side noticed.
 *
 * The cost is not the duplicate work. Every redelivered `SyncRequest` makes the
 * receiver answer with a fresh 564-byte `SyncResponse` on the same reliable
 * channel, so seven requests became a hundred replies — and the `PlaceFile` and
 * `Rmdir` the user actually asked for queued behind that flood and never
 * arrived. `Peer Sees File: FAIL` and a folder that stayed on the peer's screen
 * are both downstream of it.
 *
 * Bounded, because op ids are unbounded. A few hundred is far more than a
 * redelivery window and small enough to be free.
 *
 * The mechanism itself is generic and lives in `lib/seen-ids`; group messages
 * need the same thing for the same reason. What stays here is the evidence and
 * the key convention.
