/**
 * Loads the REVFS engine on demand, and keeps its two callers ordered.
 *
 * `lib/p2p/message-handler-routing` and `components/hooks/useConnectionHandler`
 * are both on the landing page's critical path. A static
 * `import { revfsService } from '@/lib/revfs'` in either one put the whole sync
 * engine there: 8.6 KB fetched before the landing page could render, for a
 * subsystem that can do nothing until a workspace is open and a peer sends a
 * sync operation. Deferring only one of the two did not help -- Rollup simply
 * moved the engine from the `app-services` chunk into the entry chunk, which is
 * equally eager. Both had to go.
 *
 * They cannot become two independent dynamic imports, though: the router may
 * only hand an operation to a service that already has its transport. Routing
 * both through this module makes that ordering explicit instead of relying on
 * an effect happening to run first.
