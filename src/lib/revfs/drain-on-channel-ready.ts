/**
 * Drain the RE-VFS retry queue when a P2P channel actually comes up.
 *
 * `retryPendingOps` was documented as "call when a channel becomes usable",
 * but its only production caller was the file manager's manual Sync button —
 * nothing listened for the channel itself. So operations queued while a peer
 * was unreachable, INCLUDING deletions whose local bytes were already
 * destroyed, sat indefinitely unless the user happened to press Sync; until
 * then the peer's next SyncResponse could resurrect the very paths the queue
 * was waiting to remove.
 *
 * The real signal exists: `p2p-auto-connect-service/service.ts` emits
 * `p2p:channel-ready { peerCid }` when a message channel to a peer is first
 * proven usable. This module subscribes RE-VFS to it. Separate from
 * `revfs-service.ts` only for the 250-line cap; the service wires it in
 * `initialize`, so a drain can never run against an engine with no transport.
