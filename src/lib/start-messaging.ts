/**
 * Start the ILM messenger for a session, and refuse to do it silently.
 *
 * `wasmConnectionManager.start` opens the ILM messenger handle. The comment
 * above one of its call sites states the stakes in capitals: without it, ACKs
 * are never sent for inbound messages, so outbound messages block waiting for
 * ACKs that will never come. Messaging is the product.
 *
 * All three call sites — login, orphan claim, and the shared session-startup
 * sequence — caught the failure into a `debugLog`, one of them into a bare
 * `catch (_) { }`. `debugLog` is stripped from production builds, so a failure
 * here produced no toast, no notification, no console line and no record of any
 * kind. The login path then announced "Login successful — connected to
 * workspace successfully" and handed the user a workspace whose messaging was
 * dead.
 *
 * The excuse in the old catch was "P2P may still work without ILM". It might;
 * but the user is the one who should learn that their messages are not going
 * anywhere, and they should learn it at the moment it happens rather than from
 * the silence where a reply should have been.
 *
 * I/O is injected so the decision is testable without standing up the WASM
 * client or the notification service.
