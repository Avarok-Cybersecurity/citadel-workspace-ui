/**
 * A follower tab signed in as somebody else learns the state of ITS connections.
 *
 * Seen live (bench): the leader tab (carol) connected erin's session to carol's, a file
 * crossed the link byte for byte, and erin's follower tab still read carol as "Offline".
 * Two defects, both here:
 *
 * 1. The leader's connected-peers-update was addressed to the leader's own session
 *    (broadcastStateSync stamped the sender tab's selection), and followers drop
 *    state-sync addressed to another session — so erin's tab discarded the one message
 *    that said her link was up.
 * 2. Resetting connection state on login dated an EMPTY online set as a completed poll.
 *    Followers never poll, so every peer read a confident "Offline" for the tab's life.
 *
 * Real: the targeting rule, the envelope builder, the connection-state core. Stood in:
 * the BroadcastChannel (a recorder), because there is no second tab here.
