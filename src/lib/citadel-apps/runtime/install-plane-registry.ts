/**
 * The page's planes, shared by every instance of an install on it (E9, S5). Two zones of one
 * install on one page are two instances with one session: each hears every frame for the
 * install and every topic message, so without this both served one request (the sibling then
 * Cancelled it as unknown), their calls' stream ids collided, and the first to close left the
 * topic group for both.
 *
 * - **Heads:** exactly one instance takes inbound RequestHeads, the primary: the earliest still
 *   attached. When it closes, the next one is primary.
 * - **Other frames:** a frame goes to the instance whose stream it is; one no instance holds goes
 *   to the primary, whose router answers it. Whether a frame is on a served stream or a call is
 *   the plane's to say (the relay's served ids carry RELAY_STREAM_BIT; the P2P port admitted
 *   its own), never guessed from the id, which a served stream and a call may share.
 * - **Call ids:** each instance's SDK numbers its calls from 1, so a call goes out under a page id
 *   unique to the install and rising, and its answers come back under the instance's own id. A
 *   lone instance's ids go out as they are.
 * - **Topics:** each topic is held once per install per page; the group is left when the last
 *   holder lets go, and one holder answers join requests.
 * - **Unknown apps:** a P2P head for an app no instance here runs is refused once, by the page's
 *   first seat, exactly as an unauthorised one is (S10).
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, and nothing here sends anything.
