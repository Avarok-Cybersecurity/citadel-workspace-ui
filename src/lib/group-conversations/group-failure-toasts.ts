/**
 * Telling the user when the server refuses a group operation.
 *
 * The group plane's failure variants — `GroupCreateFailure` and its seven
 * siblings — carry a message and a request id, and were mapped by nothing: no
 * failure variant of any group operation had a handler anywhere in the
 * frontend.
 *
 * That is invisible rather than merely quiet, because the create dialog
 * resolves on DISPATCH and closes. A refused create looked exactly like a
 * successful one that had not arrived yet: the form cleared, the dialog shut,
 * and the sidebar never gained the group. The same for invitations.
