 * A peer group has no server history: it is owned by no node, and the
 * workspace server refuses to answer for it. Until this existed nothing held a
 * transcript at all -- `group-persistence` stores the group LIST -- so a reload
 * showed "No messages yet" in a group you had just been talking in.

 * 500, for two reasons that both scale with it:
 *   - Each group's transcript is ONE IndexedDB value, and every recorded
 *     message is a read-modify-write of the whole of it, so the cost of each
 *     arrival grows linearly with the cap. At 500 short messages that is a few
 *     hundred KB cloned per write, which stays well inside one frame's budget.
 *   - A peer group cannot page ("Load older messages" is not offered), so
 *     everything stored is rendered at once when the group opens. 500 bubbles
 *     is a thread a person can scroll; an unbounded one is not.
 * It is five times the 100 a direct conversation holds in memory, because for
 * a peer group this IS the history -- there is nothing further back to fetch.
