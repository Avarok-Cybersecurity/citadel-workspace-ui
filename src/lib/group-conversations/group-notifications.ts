/**
 * Raise a bell notification for an incoming group message.
 *
 * Group chat produced no notification of any kind. `addMessageNotification` had
 * exactly two callers — the P2P manager and a dev-only simulator — so the whole
 * group pipeline updated the sidebar badge and stopped. No bell entry, no OS
 * notification, no sound; the backgrounded-tab path was unreachable for groups
 * entirely. Someone working in another window learned of group traffic only by
 * happening to look at the sidebar.
 *
 * The three rules below are all borrowed from the P2P path rather than invented,
 * because two notification surfaces that disagree about when to interrupt are
 * worse than one that is slightly wrong.
