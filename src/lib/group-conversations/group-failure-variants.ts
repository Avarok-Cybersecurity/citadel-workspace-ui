/**
 * Every `Group*Failure` the wire can carry.
 *
 * Its own module because `group-events.ts` sits at the 250-line cap and this is
 * a cohesive unit: one list, one rule about it, and two tests that consume it.
 *
 * The rule is that this list must equal the generated `Group*Failure` types
 * EXACTLY, in both directions, and
 * `__tests__/every-group-failure-is-handled.test.ts` enforces it. When it was
 * maintained by hand inside the loop that reads it, it drifted both ways at
 * once: it named `GroupJoinFailure` and `GroupDisconnectFailure`, neither of
 * which exists, and omitted five that do.
 *
 * The costly omission was `GroupRespondRequestFailure`. Accepting an invitation
 * commits the group locally first, so when the server refused -- a stale key, a
 * group that ended, a responder who is not the owner -- no arm matched, nothing
 * was said, and the user kept a group in their sidebar the server never counted
 * them into.
