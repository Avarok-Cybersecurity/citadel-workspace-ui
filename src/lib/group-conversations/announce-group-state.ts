/**
 * Telling the other members what this device now believes about a group.
 *
 * A rename and a role change used to stop at the local store: the protocol has
 * no field for either, so everybody else kept the old name and their own
 * randomly-minted roles. This sends the group's name, role definitions and
 * role assignments as one control envelope (group-control-codec) over the
 * ordinary group-message transport.
 *
 * The whole view, every time, rather than a delta. Receivers take only the
 * parts the sender's role permits (apply-group-control), so a snapshot costs
 * nothing in authority, and it converges a member whose copy has drifted --
 * including one whose roles were minted locally at invite time and share no
 * ids with anyone else's.
 *
 * Only for peer groups: a node-backed channel belongs to the workspace server,
 * which has its own name and roles and would refuse a peer-group key anyway.
