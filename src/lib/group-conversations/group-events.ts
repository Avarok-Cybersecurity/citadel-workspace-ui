/**
 * Turning internal-service group responses into the events the UI listens for.
 *
 * `use-group-state` subscribes to group:created, group:invite-received,
 * group:member-joined, group:member-left and group:deleted.
 * NOTHING emitted any of them, and GroupCreateSuccess was handled nowhere, so
 * the group list could never populate: createGroup fired its request, the
 * response was dropped, and the sidebar stayed empty forever.
 *
 * This is the missing half. Kept pure — a response in, events out — so the
 * mapping can be tested without a socket. The username resolver is injected
 * because the wire carries only CIDs: GroupInviteNotification names no
 * inviter, and MemberStateChanged names joiners purely by number. Resolving
 * here (from the peer roster the caller supplies) is what keeps the invite
 * path alive at all — `buildGroupFromInvite` rejects a nameless inviter, so
 * emitting an empty username silently dropped every invite ever received.
