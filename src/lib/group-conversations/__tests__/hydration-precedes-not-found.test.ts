/**
 * "Not in the store" and "the store has not answered yet" are different facts.
 *
 * `getGroup` reads the module store synchronously; the restore from IndexedDB is
 * asynchronous. `GroupChatPage` looked its group up on mount, found nothing, and
 * navigated away with "This group may have been deleted" — on every reload,
 * bookmark and shared `/groups/:id` link. Deterministically, not as a race: all
 * effects of a commit run before any microtask from that read can resolve.
 *
 * The persistence layer was added specifically to fix this, and its own comment
 * says so. Nothing ever waited for it.
