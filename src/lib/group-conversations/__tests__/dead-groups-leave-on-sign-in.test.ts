/**
 * The groups that died with the server's in-memory registry must leave the sidebar.
 *
 * Live, work.avarok.net: alice's sidebar listed twelve groups she owns, most of them wiped
 * by Worker deploys before the server persisted its registry. The reconciler that removes
 * owned groups the server no longer lists existed and was correct in isolation — but it was
 * armed by `instance:cid-changed`, and it subscribes only when the first group consumer
 * MOUNTS. Sign-in and resume both set the cid before the workspace renders, and the cid is
 * permanent, so the event had always fired, once, to nobody. The request was never sent.
 *
 * Mocked, and only these: the instance manager (a singleton over BroadcastChannel; here it
 * stands for "the session was set before we mounted"), IndexedDB (the persisted list the
 * restore reads back), and the wire send. The bindings, the store, the response mapping and
 * the reconciliation are all production code.
