/**
 * A group that ended while you were in it should not be reported as "may have
 * been deleted".
 *
 * `getGroup` returning nothing covers two situations: a stale link to a group
 * this session never knew about, and a group that ended a moment ago while the
 * page was open — deleted by its owner, or you were removed from it. The second
 * announced itself; the client acted on the event. Hedging about it is the same
 * evasion as telling someone their file picker result "may have expired" when
 * nothing expires (round 178).
