/**
 * The creator's own username reaches `group:created`.
 *
 * CI showed `Group created: {name: , ownerId: ..., ownerUsername: }` on the
 * CREATOR's page. `group:created` falls back to `ownerUsername` for the label,
 * so a group the user had just named appeared in their own sidebar with no name
 * at all -- while the copy built from the invite, one line below, had a
 * perfectly good username in it.
 *
 * `resolveSelf` returned `tab?.selectedUsername ?? ''`. When the tab context
 * has no selection, an empty string is not a name; the tab's stored session
