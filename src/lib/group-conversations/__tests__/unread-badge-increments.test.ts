/**
 * The sidebar's unread badge, last-message preview and recency sort all hang off
 * `group:message-received` — which NOTHING emitted. The inbound path emitted
 * `group:message:new`. Two half-built pipes that never met: the badge never
 * incremented for any message ever, and the recency sort never reordered
 * because `lastMessageTime` was never set.
 *
 * This drives the real response handler, so it fails if the emit is removed OR
 * if its payload stops matching what the store reads.
