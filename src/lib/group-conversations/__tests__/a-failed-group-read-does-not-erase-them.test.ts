/**
 * A group list that could not be READ must not be written back.
 *
 * `persistGroups` writes the WHOLE list for this account's key, and
 * `updateGroups` calls it on every change. Sound only when the list in memory
 * came from the key. If the read FAILED — another tab holding a `versionchange`
 * open, private mode, `getDB()` rejecting on a version mismatch, all states
 * this app has a recovery screen for — the list is empty for a reason unrelated
 * to what is stored, and one arriving invite writes a list of exactly that
 * group over every group the account had.
 *
 * The old code returned `[]` on a failed read with a comment that said "A read
 * failure is not 'no groups' — but ... the live event stream still repopulates
 * the list." It does not. `reconcileGroups` is deliberately remove-only ("a
 * group the server lists but the client does not hold is NOT added here",
 * because the wire carries only a group key), and invites are not replayed.
 * Nothing repopulates. The next reload shows one group and a bookmarked
 * `/groups/:id` reports "This group may have been deleted" — which is the
 * defect `restorePersistedGroups` was written to prevent.
 *
 * `resetGroupsForSession` already refuses to persist for exactly this reason,
 * forty lines away, in a comment that spells it out. The guard existed on one
 * of the two paths.
 *
 * This is the fifth site of one mechanism. The other four are LocalDB; this one
 * is IndexedDB, which is why `every-localdb-reader-classifies-absence` cannot
 * see it.
