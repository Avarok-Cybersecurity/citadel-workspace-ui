/**
 * A peer group could be created, invited to, left, kicked from, listed and
 * ended -- and not talked in.
 *
 * `group-requests.ts` had a wire call for every one of those and none for
 * sending a message. So `useGroupChat` sent through
 * `WorkspaceService.sendGroupMessage`, the workspace protocol, for BOTH kinds
 * of group. The server authorises that request by resolving the group id to the
 * node that owns the chat channel -- and a peer group is keyed `<cid>:<mgid>`,
 * owned by no node -- so every send came back:
 *
 *   Permission denied: not a member of this chat channel
 *
 * The server is right to refuse: it is not the workspace's channel. CI caught
 * it as `test:peer-group` passing registration, navigation and the chat tab,
 * then failing messaging in both directions.
 *
 * `InternalServiceRequest::GroupMessage { cid, message, group_key, request_id }`
 * has existed on the wire the whole time, with GroupMessageSuccess,
 * GroupMessageFailure and GroupMessageNotification all generated. Only the
 * client half was missing.
