/**
 * A change to a group's settings, put where the group actually lives.
 *
 * `settings` carries the group's roles, and therefore its permissions.
 * `use-group-roles` routes creating, editing, deleting and reordering a role
 * through `onSettingsChange`, and that callback was one line of the open page's
 * state — so role definitions never reached the store the sidebar renders and
 * `persistGroups` writes, and were gone on the next load.
 *
 * The role hook already assumed otherwise: its comment reasons about "the
 * settings the store holds" when explaining why it must build new role objects
 * rather than mutating the caller's array. That precaution was being taken
 * against a store nothing was updating.
 *
 * Sibling of `rename-group.ts`, and the same argument: the page's own state is
 * not where a group's record lives.
