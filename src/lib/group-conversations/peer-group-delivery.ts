/**
 * Handing a peer-group message to the conversation you are looking at.
 *
 * `group:message-received` drives the SIDEBAR — unread badge, preview, recency
 * sort. The open conversation reads none of it: `useGroupChat` subscribes to
 * `groupMessagingManager.subscribeToGroup`, and the workspace path feeds that
 * by calling `handleNewMessage` directly. Round 470 wired the sidebar half and
 * would have shipped a peer-group message that updated the badge and never
 * appeared in the thread.
 *
 * Only peer groups come through here. The workspace path already calls
 * `handleNewMessage` in `workspace-response-handler/group-handlers.ts`, and
 * calling it again from a shared event binding would print every workspace
 * message twice.
