/**
 * What to tell someone whose group is not in the list.
 *
 * Two different situations, which a `getGroup` miss cannot distinguish but the
 * session can: a group that ENDED while this page was open announced itself,
 * and `ended-groups` remembers that it did. Saying a group "may have been
 * deleted" about an event we watched arrive a moment earlier is the same
 * evasion as telling someone their file picker result "may have expired" when
 * nothing expires — a hedge offered in the one case where the answer is known.
 *
 * The ended wording still says "or you were removed from it", because that is
 * genuinely not distinguishable: deletion and being kicked arrive as the same
 * `GroupDisconnectNotification` and the mapping collapses them.
