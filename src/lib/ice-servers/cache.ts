/**
 * A member's relay (TURN) servers, per session, held in memory only.
 *
 * Credentials are short-lived and minted per member by the workspace server,
 * so they are fetched when a peer connection needs them and reused until 80%
 * of their lifetime has passed. A refusal — no relay configured, a Guest, an
 * old server, silence — is remembered for a minute and answered with `null`,
 * so a peer connect is never held up asking again and again for something the
 * server has just said it will not give.
 *
 * Never persisted and never logged: the grant lives in this Map and nowhere
 * else. Logs name the session and the reason, not the answer.
