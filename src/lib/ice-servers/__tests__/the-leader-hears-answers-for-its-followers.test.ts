/**
 * The leader hears the relay answer for a follower's session.
 *
 * Seen live: the leader ran the relay lookup for a follower tab's session; the answer
 * (a MessageNotification naming that session) was routed to the follower, the leader's
 * bus never saw it, and every lookup timed out at 5 s although the answer had arrived at
 * 222 ms. The port now also listens on the leader's pre-routing wire.
 *
 * Real: the port, the event emitter, the extraction and the parser. Stood in: `send`,
 * because there is no agent here.
