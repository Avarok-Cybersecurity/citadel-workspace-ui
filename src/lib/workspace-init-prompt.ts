/**
 * Whether to ask this tab for the workspace master password.
 *
 * The initialization prompt asks for the operator's `WORKSPACE_MASTER_PASSWORD`,
 * which no ordinary member has any way to obtain — and it is shown to EVERY user
 * until somebody completes it, because the root workspace is seeded at boot with
 * empty metadata and only this modal ever sets `initialized: true`.
 *
 * Dismissing it used to eject the user; that is fixed, and dismissing now records
 * the fact here instead. The onboarding intent dialog asks the same question
 * EARLIER and better — "are you setting this up, or joining?" — and someone who
 * answers "joining" has told us, in as many words, that they do not hold the
 * secret. Its own copy promises them they "should not be asked for it". Honouring
 * that answer is what this module is for.
 *
 * One key, one meaning, one place. It was a bare string literal at three call
 * sites and a fourth copy inside a test's regular expression, which is three
 * chances for a rename to half-apply — the failure mode being an unsuppressible
 * prompt, or a suppression nothing ever clears.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the TAB SESSION, matching what dismissing already did:
 * a new tab asks again. Choosing "joining" therefore grants no lasting state and
 * cannot strand a workspace — nothing actually requires initialization, since the
 * root is seeded at boot and Admin is granted at connect to the first member.
