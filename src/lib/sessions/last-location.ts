/**
 * Where a session was when its user last left it.

 * An in-tab refresh keeps its place, because the URL is the state
 * (`?nodeId`, `?channel`). The actual second-session path does not: landing
 * page → Active Sessions → claim navigates to the workspace root with no
 * params, so a user who closed the browser mid-conversation comes back
 * tomorrow, claims their session, and lands on the default office. They
 * re-find the conversation by hand, every day.
 *
 * Stored per CID beside `last-accessed`, which already records WHEN each
 * session was used and never recorded where.
 *
 * Only in-workspace locations are kept. Remembering `/connect` or the landing
 * page would send a returning user back to the screen they were trying to get
 * past — the one place a "restore where you were" feature must not take them.
