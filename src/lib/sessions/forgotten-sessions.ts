/**
 * Sessions this tab has removed, held until the server stops reporting them.
 *
 * Deregistering a session removes it locally and then reloads the list, and the
 * reload can hand back the session that was just deleted: `GetSessions` answers
 * from a connection map the deregistration has not propagated to yet. Worse,
 * deregistering stops the WASM client, whose reconnection fires
 * `on-ws-connection-success` — which reloads the list again, from the same
 * not-yet-caught-up server, at a moment nobody chose.
 *
 * `sign-out-session` already does the removal LAST for this reason, and its
 * comment explains why. That is enough against the one reload it performs
 * itself and no help at all against a reload triggered by a reconnection
 * afterwards. CI reported exactly the surviving half: "Deregister Removes: FAIL"
 * beside "Deregister Permanent: PASS" — gone after a reload, still on screen
 * before one.
 *
 * A tombstone rather than a timeout: the condition is "the server still says
 * this exists", so the thing to wait for is the server no longer saying it, not
 * an interval somebody guessed. It clears the first time a list comes back
 * without the session.
 *
 * And it gives up after a while, because a deregistration that FAILED
 * server-side leaves the session listed for ever, and a tombstone with no
 * bound would hide a live session permanently with no way for the user to
 * reach it. A row that lingers is a nuisance; a session you cannot get back to
 * is lost work.
 *
 * Bounded by TIME, not by a count of lists. The first bound allowed three
 * lists, and CI showed the row returning anyway: lists arrive in bursts -- the
 * removal performs one, the reconnection it causes performs another, and the
 * navbar refreshes on its own -- so three of them can pass in a second, while
 * the thing being waited for is the server propagating a deletion. Counting
 * the wrong unit made the bound expire before the condition it was bounding
 * could resolve.
 *
 * Session-scoped by design. A reload is a fresh answer from the server, and by
 * then the deletion has landed.

/**
 * How long a session may stay hidden while the server still lists it.
