 * The CID the agent holds for this account right now, if it holds one.
 *
 * The stored record's CID is a copy, and copies go stale -- a boot used to
 * erase them all. The agent's live list is the authority the landing page
 * resumes from; matched by username and by the typed host, since behind the
 * edge `server_address` is the resolved address (see same-server).
 *
 * A session whose address cannot be read as a host at all (no `server_host`, and
 * a bare IP for `server_address`) cannot be judged by server. It is taken only
 * when it is the one live session with that username; a readable, different
 * host stays a mismatch, because taking it would switch to another account.
