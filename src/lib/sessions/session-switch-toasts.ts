/**
 * What a session switch says while it runs, as ONE notice that changes.
 *
 * Resuming a session from the landing page raised "Reconnecting... Loading
 * bob0924" and then, a moment later, "Connected! Now viewing bob0924" -- as two
 * toasts, so both sat on screen together, one saying it was still working and
 * the other that it was done. Both were styled as successes, too, so the one
 * still in progress wore a tick.
 *
 * Every notice of one switch shares an id, and Sonner replaces a toast with the
 * same id rather than stacking a second: the progress notice BECOMES the
 * outcome. Both switch paths (the previous-sessions bar and the login
 * redirect) build their notices here, so they cannot come apart again.
