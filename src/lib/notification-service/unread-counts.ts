 * NOT looking at is the only signal that something happened there, and it was
 * being cleared by a bell opened somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * Notifications with no `recipientCid` are not session-scoped and are counted
 * against no session — they are shown in every panel, and attributing them to
 * one would make its badge wrong for every other.
