/**
 * The per-session unread badge could never change.
 *
 * `notifyUnreadChange()` is the only emitter of `unread-count-changed`, and
 * `useOrphanSessions` turns that event into the session switcher's per-account
 * unread badge and the attention glow beside it — under a comment reading "The
 * glow the chip was built for, and which nothing used to start".
 *
 * Nothing was broken. It was worth checking anyway, because a count that is
 * announced when it rises and not when it falls is a badge that only ever
 * climbs, and that is a defect this codebase has shipped before: `markAsRead`
 * on the GROUP store had zero callers for exactly that reason.
 *
 * The announce is load-bearing for a visible badge and nothing pinned it, so
 * these tests stay. All four mutation paths announce: add, read, read-all and
 * remove.
