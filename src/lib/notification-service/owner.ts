/**
 * Who announces a notification outside the page: the agent or the browser.
 *
 * One notification per message, but never none. An agent that hosts the
 * account's conversations raises a native notice for a message
 * (kernel/notices/decide.rs) -- and that notice reaches the OS only through a
 * notifier attached to the agent: today the macOS menu-bar app, subscribed to
 * the notice plane (apps/macos-agent/NoticeClient.swift). Windows and Linux
 * have none, so there the agent's notice goes nowhere.
 *
 * So the agent owns a conversation's message only when it hosts it AND a
 * notifier is attached; everything else is the browser's. Handing it to the
 * agent on hosting alone left a hosted message with no notification at all.
 *
 * The agent knows whether one is attached (`NoticeHub::is_heard`) but does not
 * tell its windows, so callers pass `notifierAttached: false` until it does:
 * the browser owns every notification, and a Mac running the menu-bar app may
 * see a message twice -- a duplicate, not a silence.
 *
 * Pure: the caller finds out what the agent does (capabilities.ts).
