/**
 * The workspace address a user types, and the port they should not have to.
 *
 * The address reaches the agent as `host:port` -- it dials a socket, so a port
 * is always sent. But requiring the user to TYPE one made the commonest case
 * the fiddly one: somebody handed a workspace called `citadel.example.com` had
 * to know a number nobody told them, and a bare hostname failed after a
 * thirty-second timeout.
 *
 * So the port is assumed unless given. Typing `citadel.example.com` and typing
 * `citadel.example.com:12400` do the same thing; typing
 * `citadel.example.com:9000` still goes to 9000.
 *
 * AMBIGUOUS INPUT IS NOT GUESSED AT. A bare IPv6 literal (`::1`) has colons
 * that are not a port separator, and there is no honest way to tell it from a
 * typo. Those are returned unchanged so the address is refused by something
 * that can say why, rather than silently turned into a different address.
 */

 * The port assumed when the user gives none.
 *
 * 12400 is what a Citadel workspace server listens on publicly -- it is the
 * port `citadel.avarok.net` serves, the one in every example, and the one an
 * operator publishing a bare hostname means. A local development server on
 * 12349 is reached by typing its port, which is the case that is already
 * explicit and stays that way.
