/**
 * Whether anything on screen has unsaved changes.
 *
 * `use-unsaved-mdx-guard` arms `beforeunload`, which covers closing the tab and
 * nothing else — its own footer comment refers to "any future navigation
 * guard". In-app navigation therefore threw the buffer away silently: one click
 * on a sidebar node unmounts the editor (BaseOffice is keyed by node), and the
 * user's work is gone with no prompt.
 *
 * A router-level blocker (`useBlocker`) would cover every path at once, but it
 * requires a data router and this app mounts `<BrowserRouter>`. Until that
 * migration, navigation sources consult this before leaving. The store is here
 * rather than in the guard so the sources do not import editor internals, and so
 * there is one answer to "is anything dirty" rather than one per surface.
 *
 * Known gap, deliberately: browser Back/Forward is a popstate, which neither
 * `beforeunload` nor a call-site check can intercept. That one needs the data
 * router.
