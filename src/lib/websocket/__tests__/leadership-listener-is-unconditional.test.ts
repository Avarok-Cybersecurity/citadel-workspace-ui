/**
 * The promotion/demotion listener lived inside `initializeAsFollower`, so a tab
 * that BOOTED as leader never registered it. `closeLeaderClient` has no other
 * caller, so on demotion that tab kept a live socket whose handler discarded
 * every inbound frame: the browser held two sockets, the sessions on the old one
 * went permanently deaf, and the tab proxied new requests to a leader that had
 * never seen them.
 *
 * Asserted from source because the class under test opens a real WebSocket in
 * its leader path; the discriminating property is WHERE the call sits, which
 * source can answer exactly. Comments are stripped first.
