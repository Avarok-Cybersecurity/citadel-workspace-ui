/**
 * `connect()` must always send Connect. Every time, with the credentials.
 *
 * It used to look up the agent's active sessions by USERNAME alone and, when
 * the local store held no matching CID, claim the session and return — without
 * sending anything. The password the user typed was used by nobody: not here,
 * not by the agent (whose own reuse branch did not check it either), and not by
 * the server, which was never asked.
 *
 * That is the same defect removed from `useLoginHandler` one layer up. Its
 * comment says the decision belongs where it can actually be made; this is what
 * stopped it from being made at all — the repo's own
 * fixes-that-were-never-propagated pattern, on a security check.
 *
 * It also broke the login it silently completed: the claim carries its own
 * request id, so the caller waiting on ITS id waited out 30 seconds and
 * reported a connection timeout for a login that had in fact happened.
