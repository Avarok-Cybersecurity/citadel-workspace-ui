/**
 * A refusal must not be read as an established connection.
 *
 * `PeerConnectAccept` answers BOTH outcomes with `PeerConnectAcceptSuccess`,
 * because both are successes from the service's side: the answer was
 * delivered. The type name was the whole message, so matching on `request_id`
 * alone treated "your refusal was sent" as "they accepted".
 *
 * That exact confusion, on `PeerRegisterSuccess`, was live: declining a
 * registration ran the acceptance path, marked the declined peer registered,
 * and had auto-connect open a connection to the person just refused.
 *
 * The response now carries `accept`, and this pins both directions — a rule
 * that refused everything would satisfy the decline case on its own.
