/**
 * A request in flight when the socket drops must fail immediately.
 *
 * The internal service keys responses to the connection that asked, and a
 * reconnect is a new connection with a new uuid — so a request sent on a socket
 * that has since died can never be answered. It used to sit out its full budget
 * anyway, and the budgets are long: 30s for a peer connect or a disconnect, 35s
 * for a peer list, 60s for a file download, 120s for the file picker. The user
 * watches a spinner for a minute over a socket that is gone, and is then told
 * the request "timed out", which names the wrong cause.
