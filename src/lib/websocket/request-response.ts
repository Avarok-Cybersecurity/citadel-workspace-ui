/**
 * A pending request cannot outlive the socket it was sent on.
 *
 * When the WebSocket dies, the internal service has no route back: it keys
 * responses to the connection that asked, and a reconnect is a NEW connection
 * with a new uuid. So every request in flight at that moment is already dead —
 * but each one used to sit out its full budget first, and those budgets are not
 * small: 30s for a peer connect or a disconnect, 35s for a peer list, 60s for a
 * file download, 120s for the file picker. The user watches a spinner for a
 * minute over a socket that is gone, and then gets "timed out", which names the
 * wrong cause.
 *
 * Rejecting on the drop turns a minute of false hope into an immediate, true
 * message. Only the leader tab's client emits this; a follower's request dies
 * with its leader and is covered by the leader-change path instead.
