/**
 * How a file PULL reports that it finished, in one place.
 *
 * Two routes pull staged files — the RE-VFS tree (`revfs-io-download.ts`) and
 * async file transfers (`file-transfer/server-download.ts`) — and both were
 * written against the same wrong idea of what the service sends back. RE-VFS was
 * corrected; the file-transfer copy was not, and kept every one of the original
 * mistakes:
 *
 *   - It waited on `FileTransferStatusNotification`, which the internal service
 *     emits from exactly one place: `respond_file_transfer.rs`, the accept /
 *     decline flow for STANDARD transfers. A pull auto-accepts and streams
 *     ticks, so the success branch was unreachable and every download sat until
 *     its timeout.
 *   - It read `status.response?.download_path`. `response` is a plain `bool` on
 *     the wire (`FileTransferStatusNotification` in the internal-service types),
 *     so that expression is `undefined` even when it matches — the resolved
 *     "download path" was a field that has never existed.
 *   - It correlated on `cid`, which is the SESSION's cid and matches every
 *     transfer notification the session sees. A concurrent transfer settled an
 *     unrelated pending download.
 *
 * Sharing the implementation is the point. The duplication is what let one copy
 * be fixed while the other went on being wrong, and this module exists so the
 * next protocol change lands once.
