/**
 * What the leader tab does with a message off the wire.
 *
 * Split out of initialization.ts, which is one of the files held at the repo's
 * 250-line cap, and split along this seam on purpose: everything else in that
 * file is about OWNING the socket — creating it, caching it, tearing it down on
 * demotion. This is the one part that is about a message, and it is the part
 * with a rule in it.
 *
 * The rule: the leader runs two delivery paths, and only one of them may carry
 * a given message. `instanceInboundRouter.routeMessage` forwards to the tab that
 * owns the message's CID; `broadcastWorkspaceResponse` posts it to every tab,
 * which then filters by CID. Broadcasting something the router already delivered
 * hands the owning tab the same message twice, and a duplicated group invite is
 * a duplicated auto-accept.
 *
 * The gate used to ask whether the type was in `CID_ROUTED_NOTIFICATIONS` — a
 * list written to stop request_id routing, borrowed here for a different
 * question. It held nine of the internal service's seventeen notification
 * variants, so everything that routes by CID without being on it arrived twice:
 * every group notification (all seven are built with `request_id: None` and a
 * recipient `cid`), and `DisconnectNotification`, which the router already
 * broadcasts to everyone.
 *
 * Asking the router what it actually DID cannot drift the way a hand-kept list
 * of type names does.

 * follower and the leader's own bus never sees it. Seen live: every such lookup timed out
 * at 5 s with its answer already delivered at 222 ms, and the connection went ahead
 * without a relay. Routing is unchanged; this only lets the asker observe.
