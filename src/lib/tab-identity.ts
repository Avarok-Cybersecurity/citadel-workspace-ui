 * looks it up in the saved accounts, returning null when there is no record —
 * and stored sessions hold saved credentials, so a user who declined to save
 * them, or whose store has not loaded yet, has a perfectly good selection and
 * nothing for it to find.
 *
 * The username is in the selection. The full name is only on the saved account,
 * which is the one thing worth going there for.
 *
 * `TopBar`, `usePeerDiscovery` and `WorkspaceView` each work this way already,
 * spelled out by hand. `BaseOffice` went straight to the session and fell
 * through to `'unknown'` for the id `OfficeChatTabs` uses to decide which
 * messages are the reader's own — no own-message styling, no edit, no delete,
 * on their own messages. `resolveCurrentUserId` did the same, and every
 * permission gate in the app bailed with "nobody is signed in on this tab".
 *
 * One function, so the next caller inherits the order rather than rediscovering
 * why it matters.
