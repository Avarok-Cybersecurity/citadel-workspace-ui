/**
 * One byte-size format, because four disagreed.
 *
 * There were four implementations and they produced different strings for the
 * same number:
 *
 *   file-transfer-helpers   toFixed(1), "0 Bytes"    1.46 MB -> "1.5 MB"
 *   transfer-format         toFixed(2), "0 Bytes"    1.46 MB -> "1.46 MB"
 *   vfs-content-helpers     toFixed(1), "0 B"        units B/KB/MB/GB
 *   lib/utils               toLocaleString, adds TB
 *
 * The first two are the same feature: a transfer bubble and the transfer
 * lifecycle showed the same file at two different sizes, in the same view.
 *
 * One decimal place, because the second digit of a megabyte is noise to the
 * person reading it and the disagreement it caused was not. TB is kept from the
 * utils version — a workspace can hold one.
