/**
 * Half-written messages, kept when you look at another conversation.
 *
 * The composer's text was plain component state, and the chat is keyed by peer
 * — deliberately, because an unkeyed composer leaked one conversation's draft
 * into another. So switching conversations unmounted the composer and the draft
 * went with it: mid-message to Alice, you click Bob to check something she
 * asked about, and your paragraph is gone. Silently. Every chat product this
 * one resembles keeps it.
 *
 * The keyed remount stays — it is the fix for the worse bug — and the text
 * lives out here instead, one entry per conversation. Held in memory only: a
 * draft is a thought in progress, and persisting it to disk on a product whose
 * subject is privacy is a decision to make deliberately rather than as a side
 * effect of fixing this.
