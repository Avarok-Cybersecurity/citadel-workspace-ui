 * The manager previously armed one timer in start() and retired it on the
 * first transition out of `ringing-out`, while the heartbeat watchdog refuses
 * to arm until `active`. That left two reachable states with no guardian:
 *
 *  - `connecting` loses the ring timer at the instant it is entered. A group
 *    call where one invitee's media session fails leaves the participant map
 *    as {B: invited, C: left} — not everyone-gone, nobody active — so the call
 *    rested there permanently with the camera live and no timer anywhere.
 *  - `ringing-in` never had one. If the caller's tab is killed no CallEnd is
 *    sent, so the callee rang indefinitely with the tone looping.
 *
 * Re-armed only when the status actually changes, so participant churn within
 * a status does not keep pushing the deadline out.
