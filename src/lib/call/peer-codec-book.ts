/**
 * What each peer in a call has told us about codecs.
 *
 * Two facts per peer, from signalling: what they can DECODE (so our sender can
 * pick something they can play) and what they will SEND (so our decoder for
 * them is configured for what actually arrives). Collected here rather than in
 * the manager because the manager's job is ordering, not remembering — and
 * before this existed the capabilities were received and thrown away, which
 * worked only when both machines happened to share a best encoder.
