 * Keeps a call honest about who is still in it.

 * nothing ever tells them otherwise.
 *
 * Absence of media frames cannot be used as the signal: a participant who muted
 * and turned their camera off sends nothing at all and is still very much
 * present. So presence is announced explicitly, on the reliable path, and
 * silence is what means gone.
