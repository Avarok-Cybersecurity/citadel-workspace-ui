/**
 * What to show a person when a call could not start.
 *
 * `CallState.reason` for a `failed` call is whatever the media transport threw,
 * and that went straight into an alert. CI caught what that looks like:
 *
 *   The call could not start
 *   no UDP channel for peer 2181040939592097811 within 5s; it may still be
 *   negotiating (retry shortly), or the peer connection was established with
 *   UdpMode disabled
 *
 * A nineteen-digit CID, an internal mode name, and a parenthetical addressed to
 * whoever wrote the retry policy — in a `role="alert"`, which a screen reader
 * reads out in full. There is nothing in it a user can act on, and the one
 * thing they CAN do about it — wait a moment and call again — is buried in a
 * clause that reads like an aside to somebody else.
 *
 * Unrecognised text is passed through unchanged. A generic "something went
 * wrong" would be worse than the raw string: at least the raw string can be
 * searched for. The raw text is kept alongside the translation either way, so
 * nothing is lost to whoever is debugging.
