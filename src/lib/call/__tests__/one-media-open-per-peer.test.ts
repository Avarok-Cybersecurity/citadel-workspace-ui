/**
 * Two callers wanting a peer's session open must produce one open, not two.
 *
 * `openSessions` records COMPLETION, so between `transport.openSession(cid)`
 * being called and its promise resolving, the "already open?" guard is false
 * for anybody else. And there are two callers:
 *
 *   - `accept()` opens a session for every peer that has already answered;
 *   - the `CallAccept` handler opens one for the peer that just answered.
 *
 * In a group call those run for the same peer at the same time. The internal
 * service refuses the second:
 *
 *   a media open or teardown is already in progress with this peer; retry shortly
 *
 * and CI reported it as the call failing — `call-group.spec.ts`, all three
 * "decodes frames from TWO distinct peers" cases.
