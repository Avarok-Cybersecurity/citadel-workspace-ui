/**
 * This tab owns exactly one call, and two paths ask whether it is free.
 *
 * The group entry path has refused a second call since it was written. The 1:1
 * path never did: the chat header gates its call buttons only on whether the
 * peer is connected, so from any OTHER conversation during an active call both
 * buttons were live. Pressing one re-entered `CallSession.start` with the
 * `starting` promise already settled, overwriting `localStream` and `pump`
 * WITHOUT stopping either — the first stream orphaned with the camera light on
 * until a page reload, two pumps feeding one encoder, and the original peer
 * never sent a CallEnd, evicted only by their own 20s silence timeout believing
 * the other side had vanished.
 *
 * One rule, one module, so the two answers cannot diverge again.
