/**
 * A drawn point went on the wire once per pointer event, per participant.

 * `onPointerMove` fires 120 or more times a second, and `sendAnnotation` emits

 * signals a second onto the reliable call-signal chain — the same chain
 * `CallEnd` travels on, so hanging up queued behind somebody's doodle.
 *
 * The receiver joins points into a polyline, so a coarser rate costs a slightly
 * more angular line. Not capping it costs a shared transport nobody else can
 * get onto.
