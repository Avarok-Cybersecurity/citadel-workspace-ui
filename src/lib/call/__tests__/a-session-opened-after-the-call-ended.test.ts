/**
 * A media session confirmed after the call ended was registered and never
 * closed.
 *
 * `openSessionOnce` awaits `transport.openSession(cid)`, then adds the peer to
 * `openSessions` and applies `peer-connected`. Opening a session is a real
 * round trip to the internal service with a connect budget measured in tens of
 * seconds, and the call can end — hung up, declined, failed — at any point
 * inside it.
 *
 * The FAILURE path already knows this: it re-reads the state after the await
 * and returns if the call is `ended` or `failed`, because "a call that ended
 * while we were waiting has nothing left to open a session for". The SUCCESS
 * path never re-read anything. So a late-confirming open:
 *
 *   - added the peer to `openSessions` after `closeAllSessions` had already run,
 *     leaving a live media session on the service that nothing would ever close
 *     — a camera and a UDP channel held open until the page was closed;
 *   - applied `peer-connected` to a call that had ended, which is the event that
 *     moves a call to `active` and starts the duration clock.
 *
 * The window is the whole open. It is not a narrow race.
