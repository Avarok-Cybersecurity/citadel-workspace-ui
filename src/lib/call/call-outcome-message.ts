 * What to tell the caller about a call that never connected.
 *
 * The reducer records a reason on every terminal state, and `CallState.reason`
 * is documented as being there "for the UI to explain itself" — but both call
 * surfaces hide the `ended` status, so every outcome presented identically: the
 * outgoing panel silently vanished with a down-chime. Declined, busy, no
 * microphone and forty-five seconds unanswered were indistinguishable.
 *
 * `no-devices` is the case that makes this matter: the callee's client sends it
 * precisely so the caller knows to try another way, and it was the outcome most
 * likely to be read as "they ignored me".
 *
 * Returns null when there is nothing worth saying — a normal hangup, or a
 * reason this build does not recognise. Silence is better than a toast that
 * says "the call ended because it ended".
