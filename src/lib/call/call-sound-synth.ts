/**
 * The Web Audio rendering layer for call sounds.

 * Tones are synthesized rather than sampled: a few oscillator lines replace an

 * nothing on the bundle. This module holds ALL the audio I/O so the cadence
 * and policy logic in call-sounds.ts stays pure and testable.
 *
 * Nothing here may ever throw. Sound is a nicety layered over a call that must
 * keep working when the browser's autoplay policy refuses playback.
