/**
 * One account must not see, or accept, another account's contact requests.
 *
 * Both lists were written to flat keys — `pending_peer_requests` and
 * `outgoing_peer_requests` — in LocalDB bucket `0n`, which every account on the
 * device shares. On a product that explicitly expects several accounts in one
 * browser, that put one account's incoming contact requests in another's list.
 * Accepting one there establishes a real P2P registration under the wrong CID.
 *
 * Message pages had exactly this defect and were fixed by putting the owner in
 * the key. This is the same fix, in the subsystem next door.
