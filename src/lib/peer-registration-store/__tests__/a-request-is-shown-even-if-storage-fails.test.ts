/**
 * Somebody asked to connect. That has to reach the screen.
 *
 * `handleIncomingRequest` pushed the request into memory, then awaited two
 * things before telling anyone: writing it to LocalDB, and reading the current
 * session CID. Either await throwing took the method with it, so `emitUpdate`
 * never ran — and the caller above logs and swallows. The app knew a request
 * existed and nothing on screen said so.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical here. LocalDB writes are refused when the ownership
 * gate cannot place the session (round 250 was one such refusal, on a key that
 * could never be written at all), and CI shows the far side polling twenty
 * times for a badge that never appears.
 *
 * The badge is how a person learns a request exists. Persistence is for
 * surviving a reload; failing at that must not also mean failing to mention it.
