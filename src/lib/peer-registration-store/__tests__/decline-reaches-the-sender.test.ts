/**
 * Declining a peer request has to tell the sender.
 *
 * `declineRequest` removed the local entry and nothing else — the backend's
 * `PeerRegisterRespond { accept: false }` had zero callers anywhere in the UI.
 * Two permanent consequences:
 *
 * - The sender's outgoing store resends every five minutes forever, and the
 *   recipient's dedup only checks LIVE pending requests, so the declined request
 *   reappeared on their screen every five minutes, indefinitely.
 * - The sender sat on a disabled "Awaiting Response…" with no cancel, never
 *   learning they had been declined.
 *
 * Neither side had a way forward except the recipient giving in.
