/**
 * A read that failed must not authorise writing the whole list back.
 *
 * Every persist in this module writes the WHOLE list for a key. That is sound
 * only when the in-memory list is a faithful copy of what is stored — which is
 * true only if the key was actually read. This file's read path used to erase
 * that distinction: a KV rejection, a send rejection and a timeout all resolved
 * `undefined`, indistinguishable from "the key holds nothing".
 *
 * So: two pending contact requests on disk, reload, the read times out, the
 * list is empty, a third request arrives, and the third is written over the
 * key. The first two are gone and nobody is told, because the write succeeded.
 *
 * The guard lives in `persistence.ts` rather than in the service because there
 * are seven whole-list write sites across four modules. A guard in the service
 * would have covered three — the "fixed in one of the places its mechanism
 * appears" shape this repository keeps finding.
 *
 * These tests drive the real `localDBGet`/`localDBSet` through a faked
 * `websocketService`, so the production classification runs. Nothing in the
 * module under test is mocked.
