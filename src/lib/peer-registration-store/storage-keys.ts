 * Where one account's contact requests are stored.
 *
 * Both lists were written to flat keys — `pending_peer_requests` and
 * `outgoing_peer_requests` — in LocalDB bucket `0n`, which every account on the
 * device shares. On a product that explicitly expects several accounts in one
 * browser, that means one account's incoming contact requests appear in
 * another's list, and the second account can accept a request that was
 * addressed to the first. Accepting establishes a real P2P registration under
 * the wrong CID.
 *
 * This is the same defect that message pages had, fixed the same way: the owner
 * goes in the KEY, so the sharing is removed rather than policed. The legacy
 * key stays readable so requests already on disk are not orphaned — and because
 * that read returns everyone's, the loaders filter it by owner too.
