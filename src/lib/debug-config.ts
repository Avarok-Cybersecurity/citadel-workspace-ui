 * almost every spec and each one would then have to click through a tour it is
 * not testing. Account creation already costs 9 UI interactions (11 for the
 * first user, who also initialises the workspace) across two full page loads --
 * see integration-tests/src/lib/account.ts. Onboarding on top of that would be
 * paid ~90 times per suite run to assert nothing.
 *
 * On in production, where a first-time operator has no idea that "Create
 * Account" on a bare address is also how they become the administrator.
 *
 * Forced on in any build by an explicit opt-in, which is how the onboarding
 * specs exercise it without a production build:
 *   - `?onboarding=1` in the URL, or
 *   - `localStorage.setItem('citadel:onboarding', 'true')`
 *
 * And forced OFF by `?onboarding=0`, so a production-mode Playwright run can
 * still create its fixtures cheaply and opt in only for the specs under test.
 * Without that, testing onboarding against a production build would mean every
 * setup account pays for it again.
