/**
 * `cancelRetry` used to delete the attempt entry only when a retry timer
 * existed — and `timeout` is null until a retry is actually scheduled. So a
 * session that connected on its FIRST attempt kept its entry forever, and the
 * scheduler skips any session already present in that map. Auto-reconnect never
 * fired again for that account for the life of the tab: succeeding once
 * disabled the recovery path.
 *
 * These assert on the map after the call, which is the state the scheduler
 * actually reads.
