/**
 * One failed session query must not disable auto-reconnect for ever.
 *
 * `reconnectAttempts` had exactly one delete path — `cancelRetry`, reached only
 * from `applyConnectionSuccess` on `ConnectSuccess`. Two things fed it entries
 * that could never be removed:
 *
 *  - the poll used `getActiveSessions()`, which returns `[]` when the request
 *    FAILS. Its own contract says "failure does NOT mean there are no
 *    sessions". So one GetSessions timeout made every stored session look
 *    inactive and scheduled a reconnect for all of them;
 *  - each of those is answered `SessionAlreadyActive` by the agent, which was
 *    not listened for at all, and `ConnectFailure` only logged.
 *
 * After that, `if (reconnectAttempts.has(sessionKey)) continue` skipped every
 * account for the life of the tab: nothing reconnected until logout, a leader
 * change, or the user toggling the setting off and on.
 *
 * These drive the real `reconnectToDisconnectedSessions` over a faked connection
 * manager, because the defect is in what it does with a failed answer rather
 * than in any single function's return value.
