 * Three call sites — login, registration and workspace initialization, which

 * `err instanceof Error ? err : String(err)` before calling this. `String()`
 * on a structured rejection is `[object Object]`, and the revfs and websocket
 * layers both reject with one. That string then matches none of the branches
 * below, is not protocol jargon and is under 200 characters, so it reached the
 * user through the passthrough as:
 *
 *   Something went wrong: [object Object]
 *
 * Taking `unknown` and normalising here removes the coercion from all three at
 * once, rather than asking each to remember.
