/**
 * Peer Display
 *
 * How a peer is named in the UI. One module so every surface — conversation
 * list, peer discovery, pending requests, account switcher — answers the
 * question identically.
 *
 * The rule: a CID is an internal routing identifier and is never a person's
 * name. Surfaces previously rendered `User 70409342...` (the first 8 digits of
 * a decimal u64) as the display name and the next 16 digits as the subtitle,
 * which is unreadable, unmemorable, and indistinguishable between two peers
 * whose CIDs happen to share a prefix.
 *
 * When no username is known we derive a SHORT HANDLE instead: base36 of the
 * CID's low bits, which is compact, stable for a given peer, and visibly a
 * handle rather than a truncated number pretending to be a name.
 *
 * "No username is known" is not the same as "the username field is empty". The
 * peer pipeline fills that field with placeholders -- 'Unknown', 'User 7040934',
 * 'Peer 4f2a1c', 'Loading...' -- and five separate sites hand-rolled their own
 * idea of which strings those were, using three different definitions. A peer
 * called 'User 12345' was a placeholder to the registration service and a real
 * name to the sidebar, so the same peer was named differently depending on
 * which surface you looked at, and a placeholder that reached the wrong check
 * was preserved forever in preference to the real name arriving behind it.
 * `isPlaceholderName` is that judgement, once.
