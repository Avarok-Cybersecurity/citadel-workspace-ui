/**
 * What this tab does when the agent reports on its link to the workspace server.
 *
 * A server deploy drops every client's connection. The agent now reconnects on
 * its own and says so; the page used to learn of it only as a burst of failed
 * requests. While the agent retries, the tab says "Reconnecting to <server>…";
 * when it is back, the P2P links the drop took down are brought up again; when
 * the agent gives up, the user is sent to sign in to that same account.
 *
 * Only this tab's own session counts. The notifications are routed by cid, but a
 * leader tab also sees ones no live tab claims, and acting on those would put
 * another account's banner on this one — so a cid that is not ours is ignored.
