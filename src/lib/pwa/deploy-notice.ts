 * running code the server no longer serves: its lazy chunks 404, and the agent it
 * talks to may already speak the newer protocol. So it is a banner that stays
 * until the page is reloaded (DeployBanner).
 *
 * - `waiting`: the service worker has the new build installed; accepting hands it
 *   control (SKIP_WAITING) and reloads.
 * - `activated-elsewhere`: another window accepted it; this one only reloads.
 * - `deployed`: found by polling `/version.json` in a page no worker controls;
 *   a plain reload fetches the new build.
