/**
 * Make the app shell shrink when the on-screen keyboard opens, on browsers that
 * do not honour `interactive-widget=resizes-content`.
 *
 * That viewport key is what stops `h-dvh` from keeping its full height while the
 * keyboard covers the bottom of the screen — the chat shell is
 * `overflow-hidden` with the composer as its last flex child, so without it the
 * composer ends up underneath the keyboard. The meta tag in index.html says
 * exactly this.
 *
 * But `interactive-widget` is a Chromium-only viewport key. WebKit does not
 * implement it, so on iOS — the platform whose installed PWA is the product's
 * primary mobile surface — the bug the meta tag exists to fix was still live.
 *
 * `visualViewport` is the cross-browser way to ask how much of the page the user
 * can actually see. Publishing its height as `--app-height` lets the shell use
 * it in place of `100dvh`, in the same measured-CSS-variable style the offline
 * banner already uses for its own height.
