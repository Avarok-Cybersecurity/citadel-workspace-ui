/**
 * Which build is deployed, told apart from which build this page is running.
 *
 * The build writes `/version.json` naming its entry chunk (vite.config.ts). The
 * entry's file name carries a content hash that Rollup derives from everything
 * it imports, so it changes whenever the shipped code does and stays the same
 * when it does not — no build counter, clock or environment variable to set. A
 * running page knows its own entry from `import.meta.url` in main.tsx, so the
 * id never has to be baked into the bundle it identifies.
 *
 * Why a file and a poll, rather than the service worker alone: the worker only
 * exists after a first visit, in a secure context, where registration did not
 * fail, and only under a build that registers one. A tab without it — a first
 * visit, a browser that refused it — never learned a deploy had happened. The
 * file is a few dozen bytes, served statically, fetched with `no-store`.
