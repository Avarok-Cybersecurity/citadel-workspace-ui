/**
 * Hand control to a service worker that is sitting in `waiting`, if there is one.
 *
 * A plain `location.reload()` does NOT activate a waiting worker: the old one
 * keeps controlling the page, so it keeps serving the old precached shell. That
 * is fine for an ordinary reload, and fatal for the one case where it matters —
 * a build that crashes at render.
 *
 * In that case the error boundary is showing, which means `PwaUpdatePrompt` is
 * unmounted, and it is the ONLY thing in the app that sends SKIP_WAITING. A fixed
 * build can therefore download, install, and sit in `waiting` for ever while the
 * user presses "Reload workspace" against the same crash. Recovery otherwise
 * requires closing every tab on the origin, which nothing tells the user.
 *
 * Resolves `true` only if a new worker actually took control. The caller should
 * reload either way — the user pressed a button and is owed an outcome.
