/**
 * What to tell a person when a message to a peer will not send.
 *
 * `describeFailure` prefers the transport's real reason over a fixed "Please
 * try again", and that was right: it lets a user tell a permanent refusal from
 * a retryable one. It does not TRANSLATE, though, so what reaches the toast is
 * the transport's own words:
 *
 *   No messaging handle found for local CID: 13069842581551822719.
 *   Call open_p2p_connection first.
 *   Not initialized. Call init() first.
 *   WebSocket client not available (leader without client)
 *
 * A nineteen-digit CID, two function names, and "leader" — an internal
 * multi-tab role this product never mentions anywhere in its interface.
 *
 * `lib/call/call-failure-detail.ts` is the same idea, written after CI caught
 * the call path announcing "UdpMode disabled" to a user. The messaging and
 * file-transfer paths were never given the same treatment. This is deliberately
 * a SEPARATE table rather than an extension of that one: the vocabularies do
 * not overlap — that one is about UDP and codecs, this one about messenger
 * handles and local storage — and a single table matching both would make every
 * future entry a question about which paths it applies to.
 *
 * The raw text is kept beside the translation, as the call module does. A
 * generic "something went wrong" would be worse than the raw string, because at
 * least the raw string can be searched for.
