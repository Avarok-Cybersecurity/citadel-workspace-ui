/**
 * Where one account's conversation with one peer is stored.
 *
 * Pages used to be keyed by PEER ALONE, in LocalDB bucket `0n`, which every
 * account on the device shares — on a product that explicitly expects several
 * accounts in one browser. Two accounts chatting with the same peer therefore
 * appended into the same pages, and after a reload each one's private messages
 * rendered in the other's transcript.
 *
 * An `ownerCid` stamp was added to the metadata, but it only guarded DELETION:
 * the second account's "Clear Chat History" hit a refusal that was written to a
 * debug log, so the screen emptied, the user was told it could not be undone,
 * and the history came back on the next reload.
 *
 * Putting the owner in the key removes the sharing itself rather than policing
 * it. The legacy prefix is still readable so existing history is not orphaned —
 * see `legacyConversationPrefix`.
