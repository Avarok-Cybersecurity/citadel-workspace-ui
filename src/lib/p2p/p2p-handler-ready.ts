 * registration, workspace responses, group responses, auto-connect — so the
 * count is nonzero long before the messenger, the one consumer P2P chat
 * messages exist for, has been constructed.
 *

 * was emitted twice to EIGHT listeners, and the tab's first P2P handler entry
 * appears afterwards, once the count had climbed to twelve. Gating on the count
 * would have looked correct and lost the message anyway.
