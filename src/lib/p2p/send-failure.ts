/**
 * The agent's answer when it could not send a message.
 *
 * `MessageSendFailure` is returned by the agent when the peer channel is not
 * there (`requests/message.rs`: "Peer connection for {peer_cid} not found") and
 * when the send times out. Until this module existed, the UI contained no
 * reference to that response ANYWHERE -- not in the routing rules, not in a
 * handler -- so the answer was discarded, the bubble stayed `sent`, and the
 * message went nowhere with nothing said. Measured against the live server: 125
 * such refusals in one session while both directions of a conversation showed
 * `sent` and neither arrived.
 *
 * What this can and cannot do, stated plainly. The failure carries the sender's
 * own `cid`, a human-readable `message`, and a `request_id` that belongs to the
 * transport frame rather than to any one chat message the person typed -- the
 * reliable path wraps sends in the messaging layer, which retries on its own.
 * So this does NOT mark a particular bubble failed: that would need the peer's
 * cid on the response, which is the follow-up. It reports the failure through
 * the one channel a person can see, once per peer-session and not per frame,
 * so a transport that is down stops being invisible.
