/**
 * One account's contact list appeared in another's.
 *
 * Message pages live in LocalDB bucket `0n`, which every account on this device
 * shares — the product explicitly expects several accounts in one browser.
 * `ConversationMetadata.ownerCid` exists precisely because of that: its own
 * doc-comment records that without it `cleanupStaleConversations` deleted every
 * OTHER account's history as stale.
 *
 * That stamp was wired into the DELETE path and not the READ path.
 * `loadAllMetadata` lists every `msgs_with_peer_*_metadata` key in the shared
 * bucket and returns all of them, so `loadFromStorage` seeds the conversation
 * cache with other accounts' rows and the P2P peer list renders them — who
 * Alice talks to, and her unread counts, shown to Bob.
 *
 * Unattributed legacy records are still returned. An unknown owner is exactly
 * the case where withholding is as wrong as leaking: those predate the stamp
 * and belong to whoever is reading.
