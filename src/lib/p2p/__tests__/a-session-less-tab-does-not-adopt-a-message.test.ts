/**
 * A tab logged into nobody processed another account's messages.
 *
 * One browser holds one WebSocket, and the leader tab that holds it is very
 * often the landing/connect page — a tab with no session and no cid. The
 * MessageNotification guard computed `effectiveCid = currentCid ??
 * notificationCid`, so on exactly that tab the "is this for a different
 * session?" check compared the notification's cid against itself: vacuously
 * false, and a fallback-delivered notification for ANY account was written to
 * the conversation store and emitted as `p2p:message-received` in a tab that
 * was nobody. The path even logged "WARNING: currentCid is null, using
 * notification CID as fallback" — known, and still wrong.
 *
 * The fix is the shared `isForThisSession` (a fourth hand-rolled copy of this
 * check is how the family of bugs it documents came to exist): unless both
 * cids are known and equal, the leader broadcasts the notification to the
 * follower tabs, where `handleP2PNotification` filters by cid and only the
 * owner processes it. Refusing is not dropping — the hand-off is the point,
 * and these tests assert both halves.
