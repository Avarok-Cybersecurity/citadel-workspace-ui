/**
 * A redelivered message landing exactly when a page fills was stored twice.
 *
 * `appendUnserialised` rolls the page over BEFORE it checks for a duplicate:
 *
 *   1. the current page is full, so it is saved and `latestPage` advances;
 *   2. `currentPage` becomes a fresh, EMPTY page;
 *   3. the duplicate check runs against that empty page and finds nothing;
 *   4. the message is written into the new page.
 *
 * The copy it should have matched is on the page that was just closed. Two
 * copies, in different pages, permanently — and the render-side merge dedups
 * across batches but not within one, so both show.
 *
 * The check is also only ever against ONE page, which is narrower than the
 * window it exists for: ILM's delivered-set is memory-only, so after a reload it
 * redelivers whatever is still in its persisted inbound map, and that need not
 * all fall inside the newest 50 messages.

/**
 * WHICH HALF OF THE FIX IS PROVEN, stated because the controls disagreed with
 * the commit message before this note existed.
 *
 * Two things changed: the duplicate check moved BEFORE the page rollover, and it
 * now looks at the previous page as well. Each of them alone catches the
 * boundary case above — so neither control can fail it, and the boundary test
 * proves only that *something* catches it.
 *
 * What is independently proven is the previous-page lookup, by the test directly
 * above: no page fills, so ordering is irrelevant, and disabling the lookup
 * fails it.
 *
 * The ordering change is NOT independently observable while the lookup exists.
 * It stays because checking for a duplicate before mutating page state is
 * correct on its own terms — the rollover writes a page and advances a pointer
 * for a message that is then discarded — but it is recorded here as reasoning,
 * not as something a control demonstrated.
