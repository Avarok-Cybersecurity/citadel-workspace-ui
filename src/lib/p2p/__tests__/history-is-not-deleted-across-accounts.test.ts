/**
 * One user logging in must not destroy another user's message history.
 *
 * Message pages are keyed by PEER alone — `msgs_with_peer_{peerCid}_…` — and
 * live in LocalDB bucket `0n`, which every account on the device shares.
 * Nothing recorded whose conversation a record was.
 *
 * `cleanupStaleConversations` deletes any cached conversation missing from the
 * CURRENT account's peer list — which is true of every conversation belonging
 * to a different account. So user B logging in permanently deleted user A's
 * messages, on a device this product explicitly expects to hold several
 * accounts, and the deletion is unrecoverable.
 *
 * These drive the real `deleteConversationPages` and assert on what reaches
 * LocalDB, because the whole defect is about which keys get a delete.
