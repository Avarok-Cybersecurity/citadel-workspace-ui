/**
 * What a person is told when a peer message will not send.
 *
 * `describeFailure` prefers the real reason over a fixed "Please try again",
 * and that was the right fix -- it let a user tell a permanent refusal from a
 * retryable one. But it does not TRANSLATE, so the P2P paths hand the transport's
 * own words to a toast. Those words are:
 *
 *   No messaging handle found for local CID: 13069842581551822719.
 *   Call open_p2p_connection first.
 *   Not initialized. Call init() first.
 *   WebSocket client not available (leader without client)
 *
 * A nineteen-digit CID, two function names, and "leader" -- an internal
 * multi-tab role the product never mentions. `call-failure-detail.ts` exists
 * because CI caught exactly this on the call path and it was fixed there. The
 * messaging and file-transfer paths were never given the same treatment.
 *
 * The raw text is kept alongside the translation, as the call module does: a
 * generic "something went wrong" would be worse, because at least the raw
 * string can be searched for.
