/**
 * Clearing YOUR conversation must not delete SOMEBODY ELSE'S copy of it.
 *
 * `deleteConversationPages` checked ownership once, against the account-scoped
 * metadata, and then deleted the legacy peer-only records too — a DIFFERENT
 * record, with its own owner stamp, that nothing had looked at. The comment
 * there said the check "has already run, so this only removes records that are
 * ours"; it had not run on anything in that branch.
 *
 * Both accounts on one device having chatted with the same peer is the whole
 * precondition, and it is reachable: `appendUnserialised` stamps `ownerCid` from
 * `resolveCurrentCid()` (which falls back to stored session state) while the key
 * comes from `instanceManager.cid` directly and collapses to the legacy shape
 * when that is null — so a record can be written under the unscoped key with a
 * real owner stamp, today.
 *
 * `history-is-not-deleted-across-accounts.test.ts` cannot see this: it does not
 * mock `instanceManager`, so `instanceManager.cid` is null there,
 * `conversationPrefix` collapses to the legacy prefix, and `hasLegacyFallback`
 * is false in every one of its cases — the branch below is never entered.
