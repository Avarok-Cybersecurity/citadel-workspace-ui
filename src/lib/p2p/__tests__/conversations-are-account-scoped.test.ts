/**
 * Message pages were keyed by PEER ALONE, in LocalDB bucket 0n, which every
 * account on the device shares — on a product that expects several accounts in
 * one browser. Two accounts chatting with the same peer appended into the same
 * pages, so after a reload each one's private messages rendered in the other's
 * transcript.
 *
 * The `ownerCid` stamp only guarded deletion, so the second account's "Clear
 * Chat History" hit a debug-logged refusal: the screen emptied, the user was
 * told it could not be undone, and the history returned on reload.
