/**
 * A message's terminal send status must survive a reload.
 *
 * Both send paths mutated `message.status` in memory only. The row was
 * persisted while still `'pending'`, so that is the row read back — every
 * message the user had ever sent rendered a "sending…" clock after a reload.
 * Worse, the retry affordance is gated on `'failed'`, so a message that
 * genuinely failed could never be retried: it looked like it was still on its
 * way, forever, with no path by which it would ever be sent.
 *
 * `resendMessage` did call `updateMessageInPages` — but only after a `catch`
 * that rethrows, so it too recorded 'sent' and never 'failed'. The one status
 * worth keeping was the one guaranteed to be lost.
 *
 * These assert on what reaches the PAGE STORE, not on the in-memory object. The
 * in-memory object was always correct, which is exactly why this was invisible.
