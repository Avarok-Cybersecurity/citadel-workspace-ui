/**
 * A failed read must never be reported as an absent conversation.
 *
 * `sendLocalDBGet` rejects for BOTH "no such key" and "the request timed out"
 * / "the socket is down". Both used to come back as `null`, and the append
 * path reads `null` as "this conversation is new": it fabricates metadata with
 * `latestPage: 0` and writes a page holding just the message that triggered
 * it. That overwrites page 0 and orphans pages 1..N, because `latestPage` is
 * the only record that they exist. One 5-second timeout silently destroyed a
 * conversation, with nothing above debugLog to say so.
