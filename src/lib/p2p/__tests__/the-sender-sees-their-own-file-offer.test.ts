/**
 * The sender of a file saw nothing in their own conversation.
 *
 * `announceTransfer` sent the offer that gives the RECIPIENT a bubble, and
 * nothing added one on the sending side: the thread had no trace of the file,
 * so there was nothing to watch, cancel or open. `recordOutgoingFileTransfer`
 * is the missing step; these pin what it records.
 *
 * No mocks: the recorder takes its three effects as injected functions, and the
 * harness below records what it was asked to do.
