/**
 * Switching accounts left the previous account's messages on screen.
 *
 * `ConversationManager` is a module-lifetime cache keyed by peer, holding up to
 * 100 messages per conversation. `P2PMessengerManager.setupEventListeners`
 * binds `on-ws-connection-success`, `websocket-message` and
 * `p2p-connection-established` — and nothing for a change of session.
 *
 * So after an orphan-session claim (the multi-workspace path, an SPA navigate
 * with no reload) `instanceManager.cid` changes, the groups rescope — the group
 * store binds `instance:cid-changed` and calls `resetGroupsForSession` — and the
 * P2P cache does not. The peer list renders the previous account's
 * conversations for the new account, opening one shows the previous account's
 * message window, and the new account's own history cannot load because
 * `cachedMessagesLoaded` is already true and short-circuits the reload.
 *
 * The twin fix existed and was not carried across. That is the defect class this
 * campaign has found most often.
