/**
 * Applying a peer's edit or delete to our transcript.
 *
 * The inbound mirror of `messenger-revision.ts`, which is the outbound half.
 * Extracted when `message-handler-routing.ts` crossed the 250-line limit; the
 * two branches belong together because they answer the same question in the
 * same way, and the answer is not obvious.
 *
 * The peer's revision is AUTHORITATIVE. Our in-memory conversation is already
 * mutated by `applyEdit`/`applyDelete` before we get here, so the event is
 * emitted whether or not the write succeeds -- refusing to emit would leave the
 * screen disagreeing with memory, which is worse than either alternative.
 *
 * What must not happen is silence. Both writes return a boolean, and both were
 * discarded: a storage failure removed a message from the screen while leaving
 * it in the stored page, so it returned on reload, disagreeing with a peer who
 * had retracted it -- and the only trace was a `debugLog`, compiled out of the
 * build the user is running. `errorLog` emits in production, which is the point.
