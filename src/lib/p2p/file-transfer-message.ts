/**
 * The conversation entry for a file-transfer offer, on either side of it.
 *
 * One builder for both ends. The recipient's entry was built inside the inbound
 * handler and the sender's was never built at all, so the person who sent a
 * file saw nothing in their own thread -- no bubble to watch, cancel or open.
 * Both entries describe the same offer and are keyed by the same message id
 * (which is what lets the recipient's receipts reach the sender's bubble), so
 * they come from the same place.
