/**
 * Every conversation on this device that belongs to the account reading.
 *
 * LocalDB bucket `0n` is shared by every account in the browser -- the product
 * expects several -- so listing `msgs_with_peer_*_metadata` returns other
 * accounts' conversations too. `ConversationMetadata.ownerCid` exists for
 * exactly that reason, and its doc-comment records what happened without it:
 * `cleanupStaleConversations` treated every other account's history as stale
 * and deleted it.
 *
 * That stamp was wired into the DELETE path and not the READ path, so this
 * function returned everyone's rows and the P2P peer list rendered whom the
 * OTHER account talks to, with their unread counts.
 *
 * Extracted from message-pagination-store.ts at the 250-line cap: reading the
 * shared bucket and deciding whose records they are is one job.
