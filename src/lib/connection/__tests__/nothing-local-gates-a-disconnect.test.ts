/**
 * A disconnect must not queue behind a local write.
 *
 * Two instances of this were already found by hand. `handleLogout` persisted
 * the session list and then disconnected, so a `LocalDBSetKV` timeout left the
 * user signed out in the UI and still connected to the server (round 190).
 * `handleAuthSuccess` did the mirror: a local write that threw discarded a
 * completed registration (round 189).
 *
 * Both were written the same way for the same reason — the write looks like
 * bookkeeping that belongs with the state change, and the ordering only matters
 * when the write is slow. It is slow exactly when the agent is under load,
 * which is exactly when a user is most likely to be signing out.
 *
 * So the rule gets stated where it can be checked: in `lib/connection`, nothing
 * that writes to LocalDB may be awaited before a disconnect in the same
 * function. A guard rather than a third fix, because two independent instances
 * of one mistake is a pattern and the third would have been written the same
 * way.
