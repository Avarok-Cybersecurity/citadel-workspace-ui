/**
 * A second connect success must not erase who the session belongs to.
 *
 * `handleSuccessfulConnection` runs from the WebSocket when a ConnectSuccess
 * lands, and it knows only the CID. It ASSIGNED `{ cid }` over the connection
 * record, so anything already there went with it — including the `username`
 * that `handleAuthSuccess` writes on the login path.
 *
 * `permissionsService.getCurrentUserId()` reads exactly that username, and its
 * own comment records the consequence without the cause: "the synchronous
 * accessor is null for a user who logged IN rather than registering". A null
 * there is a permissions fetch that cannot say who it is for; CI reports it as
 * the workspace administrator's Edit button, disabled for sixty seconds, over a
 * title reading "Permissions have not been loaded for this domain".
 *
 * The same shape as the workspace metadata, which is shared with theming and
 * was being assigned over: a partial write to a shared record has to merge.
