/**
 * A session the device could not remember has to say so.
 *
 * `storeSession` returns false when the LocalDB write fails, and the header of
 * `session-management` explains why that must not throw: the account exists,
 * the credentials were accepted, and the live session is fine. What the user
 * loses is the NEXT launch -- they will have to sign in again.
 *
 * Nobody was told. The one caller that read the flag wrote a debug line and
 * carried on; the other four discarded it. So "Remember me" could fail
 * completely and the only difference the user saw was a login screen days
 * later, with nothing connecting the two.
 *
 * This is the same shape as `revfs:persist-failed`, which is emitted here and
 * turned into a notice by a mounted component -- library code does not reach
 * for the toaster. The event is emitted through the injected IO router for the
 * same reason.
