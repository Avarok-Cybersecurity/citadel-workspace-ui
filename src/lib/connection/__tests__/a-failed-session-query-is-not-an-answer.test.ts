/**
 * `getActiveSessions` is how the app decides whether you are logged in.
 *
 * It returned `[]` on every failure — WebSocket init timeout, a tab that cannot
 * send, a GetSessions response that never came, any throw — and then CACHED
 * that empty list as a valid answer. So one timeout produced "you have no
 * sessions" for the whole cache window, without re-asking, across the seven
 * surfaces that consult it.
 *
 * The worst consequence was not cosmetic. WorkspaceLoader concluded there were
 * no sessions, the loading deadline redirected to /connect, and on the way it
 * called `clearSelectedUser()` — a failed READ destroying the tab's session
 * selection. The user then re-authenticated a session that was still alive,
 * which is the SessionAlreadyActive churn the backend notes warn about.
