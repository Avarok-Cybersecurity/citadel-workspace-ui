/**
 * THE regression this file exists to prevent, in the exact shape it shipped:
 *
 * `awaitWriteResponse` settles on a `workspace:raw-response` event. Most of the
 * router's variant handlers apply the response and `return true` — the response
 * ends there and no raw event is emitted. Gating a write on such a variant makes
 * every success wait out the full 15s timeout and then tell the user "the change
 * may not have been saved", AFTER the same handler already applied it. Worse
 * than the bug it was meant to fix: role changes, theme saves, message edits and
 * deletes all did this.
 *
 * I verified the SERVER sends the variant and never checked that the CLIENT
 * router forwards it. So this drives the real router with a response of every
 * gated variant and asserts the raw event arrives — mechanically, for every
 * entry in the table, including ones added later.
