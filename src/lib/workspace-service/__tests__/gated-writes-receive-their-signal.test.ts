/**
 * Every variant a write WAITS for must actually be emitted as a raw response.
 *
 * `awaitWriteResponse` resolves on `workspace:raw-response`. The response router
 * emits that from the `Success` and `Error` branches and from its unhandled
 * fallback — but a variant with its OWN handler returns `true` and the response
 * ends there.
 *
 * So four writes gated on handled variants — UpdateMemberRole, UpdateWorkspaceTheme,
 * EditGroupMessage, DeleteGroupMessage — waited out the full 15s timeout and told
 * the user "the change may not have been saved", after the same handler had
 * already applied it. The action worked and the app said it had not: a regression
 * introduced by wiring the gate without checking the signal existed.
 *
 * Drives the REAL router, so it fails if either half drifts.
