/**
 * `sendGroupMessage` resolved when the frame left, and the composer clears on
 * resolve — so a refusal (a store failure, or the rate limiter's "Please slow
 * down") threw the user's text away: the message never appeared, and the
 * refusal arrives as a generic `Error` that no handler surfaces.
 *
 * The success variant is ALSO the broadcast every other member receives for
 * every message, so type-only matching would let someone else's message resolve
 * this write. These pin both halves.
