/**
 * The members list has to refresh after an admin changes it.
 *
 * `members:reload` was emitted only from response handlers for `AddMember`,
 * `RemoveMember` and `UpdateMemberRole` — response variants the protocol does
 * not have. All three exist as REQUESTS only; the server answers with `Success`
 * and `MemberRoleUpdated`. So those branches were unreachable and their
 * listeners could never fire: after an admin added a member, removed one, or
 * changed a role, nothing refreshed.
 *
 * It is now emitted after `awaitWriteResponse` resolves — the point at which the
 * change is known to have happened, and the only place that knows it.
