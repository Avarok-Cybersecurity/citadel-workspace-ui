/**
 * Every MUTATING workspace request must wait for the server to accept it.
 *
 * `sendProtocolRequest` resolves when the frame reaches the local WASM sink, and
 * the server answers a refusal as a RESPONSE — which can never reject that
 * promise. `awaitWriteResponse` was built to fix exactly this, and was wired to
 * four of the eleven write types.
 *
 * The seven that were missed each had a UI that reported success anyway:
 * "Member Added — {username} has been added to the workspace as {role}" for a
 * username that does not exist; "Permissions saved successfully" with the modal
 * closed; the edit composer clearing the user's text while the message kept its
 * old content; "Every member will see this theme" for a theme nobody receives.
 *
 * This asserts on the SOURCE, because the property is "no write bypasses the
 * gate" — which no single call can demonstrate, and which is exactly the kind of
 * thing that regresses when someone adds the twelfth write.
