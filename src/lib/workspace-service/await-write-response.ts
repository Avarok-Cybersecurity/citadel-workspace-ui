/**
 * Waiting for the server's answer to a write, instead of for the frame to leave.
 *
 * `sendProtocolRequest` resolves once the request reaches the local WASM sink.
 * The server answers a refusal as a RESPONSE — `WorkspaceProtocolResponse::Error`
 * — which can never reject that promise. So every write reported success on
 * SEND:
 *
 *   - "Office Deleted — Engineering has been deleted successfully" in green,
 *     the modal closed, the user navigated away from the node;
 *   - five seconds later, a red "Failed to delete node: Permission denied:
 *     EditTreeStructure required" in the opposite corner;
 *   - and the node still in the tree.
 *
 * The careful failure handling downstream was all unreachable as a result.
 * TreeNodesSection's delete dialog closes only on success and renders its own
 * `role="alert"` — but the handler it awaits swallowed its errors and always
 * resolved, so neither could ever fire.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, recorded rather than hidden: the workspace protocol carries
 * no request id (`grep -c request_id citadel-workspace-types/src/lib.rs` is 0),
 * so responses can only be matched by TYPE. Two writes of the same kind in
 * flight at once could take each other's answer. The UI issues these one at a
 * time from a modal or a confirm dialog, so that is not reachable today — but it
 * is a property of the protocol, not of this module, and the real fix is a
 * request id on the wire.
