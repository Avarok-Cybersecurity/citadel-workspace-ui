/**
 * Payload checks that tell OUR answer apart from someone else's broadcast.
 *
 * The workspace protocol carries no request id, so `awaitWriteResponse` matches
 * responses by type. That was safe while those variants were only ever sent to
 * the client that asked — and stopped being safe when the server began
 * broadcasting `Node`, `NodeDeleted` and `NodeMoved` to every other member so
 * their trees would update live.
 *
 * The consequence is worse than a mismatched toast. Alice saves a document and
 * the server is about to refuse it; Bob renames any node in the same 15-second
 * window; his broadcast `Node` resolves Alice's pending write; the editor closes
 * on "success" and reloads the stored copy over her buffer. Her text is gone
 * under a green toast — the exact data loss the write gate was built to end.
 *
 * These are narrowing checks, not identity: without a request id, two writes to
 * the SAME node in flight at once still cannot be told apart. That remains a
 * property of the protocol, and is recorded in await-write-response.

 * it surfaces as a disjoint global toast if at all, and the name is unchanged.
 *
 * Matching on `id` does not separate two writes to the SAME workspace in
 * flight at once; nothing can, without a request id. It does separate this
 * workspace's answer from another's, and a write from a concurrent read of a
 * different workspace, which is what the multi-workspace server made possible.
