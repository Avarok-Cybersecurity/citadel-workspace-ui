/**
 * A declared object store must have a reader or a writer.
 *
 * v1 declared six and used two. `sessions`, `messages`, `peers` and `instances`
 * were created in every user's browser and never written to by any commit in
 * the history of this repository — while telling anyone who read the schema
 * that conversations, peer registrations and session records were kept there.
 * They are kept in the internal service's LocalDB.
 *
 * That is the failure this repository keeps meeting from a new angle: a
 * declaration is not an implementation, and nothing had ever compared the two.
 * The store list was also written out twice — once in storage-migrations.ts and
 * once as a hand-copied union in storage-utils.ts — so every place that knew
 * the names knew them independently and none of them could notice.
