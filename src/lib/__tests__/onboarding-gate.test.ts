/**
 * `isOnboardingEnabled` is the inverse of the diagnostics gate: OFF in the
 * environment vitest and Playwright run in, ON in production.
 *
 * That inversion is the whole point, so it is what these tests pin. The
 * integration suite creates an account for nearly every spec — 9 UI
 * interactions each, 11 for the first user — and a tour rendered on top of
 * that would be clicked through ~90 times per run to assert nothing.
 *
 * Both directions are covered deliberately. A gate that is merely "off in dev"
 * would pass a dev-only suite while never having been shown to a single user;
 * a gate that is merely "on in prod" would pass while making every test pay
 * for it. Neither half is sufficient on its own.
