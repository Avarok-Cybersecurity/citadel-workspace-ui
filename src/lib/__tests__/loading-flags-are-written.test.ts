/**
 * The loading flags had no writer, so every list rendered its empty state as a
 * statement of fact while its data was still in flight.
 *
 * `emitLoadingEvent` had exactly ONE call site in the codebase — 'workspace:loading'
 * — so `state.loading.nodes` and `state.loading.members` were permanently false.
 * TreeNodesSection's guard is `if (!isLoading && !treeData)`, so every workspace
 * open told the user "Your workspace is empty. Click the + button to create your
 * first space." The "Loading..." arm inside that branch is unreachable by
 * construction, which is exactly why it read as correct.
 *
 * The listeners that LOWER the flags were already there and already correct.
 * Only the raise was missing — the same built-from-one-end shape this campaign
 * keeps finding.
