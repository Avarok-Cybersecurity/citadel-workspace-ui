/**
 * The security settings a user chooses at sign-in must reach the connection.
 *
 * `handleLogin` called `websocketService.connect(requestId, username, password,
 * undefined)`, and `auth-operations` fills that gap with
 * `getDefaultSecuritySettings()`. So every choice made in the Security Settings
 * dialog reached the hook's state and died there: a user who selected a higher
 * security level, a post-quantum KEM and a signature algorithm connected with
 * Standard / BestEffort / AES_GCM_256 and was told nothing.
 *
 * It then persisted the DEFAULTS into the stored session, so every reconnect
 * used them too — the choice was lost for the life of the session, not just the
 * first connect.
 *
 * The registration flow has always mapped these correctly. This asserts the
 * mapping the login flow now shares, and the two call sites that consume it.
