/**
 * Read-modify-write, serialised per key.
 *
 * The shape: load a record, mutate it in memory, save it back, with awaits in
 * between. Two of those at once for the same key both read the same value, each
 * applies its own change to its own copy, and the second save discards the
 * first.
 *
 * It cost a received P2P message once — delivered, acknowledged, cached, then
 * written over — and the RE-VFS tree had the identical shape with no lock at
 * all: a bulk delete under `Promise.all` had every operation capture the same
 * base tree, so the last write resurrected everything the others removed.
