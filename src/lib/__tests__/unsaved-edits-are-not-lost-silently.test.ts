/**
 * Navigating away from an unsaved edit must ask first.
 *
 * `use-unsaved-mdx-guard` armed `beforeunload`, which covers closing the tab and
 * nothing else — its own footer comment referred to "any future navigation
 * guard". So the click that loses the most work, selecting another node in the
 * sidebar, threw the buffer away silently: BaseOffice is keyed by node, so
 * selecting one unmounts the editor.
 *
 * A router-level blocker would cover every path at once, but `useBlocker`
 * requires a data router and this app mounts `<BrowserRouter>`. Until that
 * migration the navigation sources ask, and this is the shared answer they ask.
