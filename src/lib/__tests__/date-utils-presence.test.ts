/**
 * Three components each invented a different value for a fact nothing tracks.
 * UserSearch used a random offset from now, UserDirectory a literal 0 (rendered
 * as a date in 1970), and UserProfileCard `?? Date.now()` ("just now"). All three
 * stated a last-seen time to the user that was fiction.
 *
 * formatPresence exists so there is one answer, and the honest answer when the
 * value is missing is that it is not known.
