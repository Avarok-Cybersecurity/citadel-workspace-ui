/**
 * "Which session is this?" had three answers, and one of them had the order wrong.
 *
 * `lib/p2p/current-cid.ts` documents the priority: the instance manager first
 * (synchronous, set on connect), then the TAB's selection, then the tab's
 * stored session, and only then the global connection — which belongs to the
 * connection rather than to this tab, and is wrong whenever one browser holds
 * two sessions.
 *
 *   - `p2p/messenger-cid-resolver.ts` carried a second copy of the chain, with
 *     its own 500ms literal where the authority uses `CID_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_MS`.
 *   - `peer-registration-store/state.ts` carried a third — with `connectionInfo`
 *     moved to position TWO, ahead of the tab's own selection. So a browser with
 *     two sessions scoped one tab's pending contact requests by the other tab's
 *     CID.
 *   - `CallLayer` passed the bare `getConnectionInfo()?.cid`: the last step of
 *     the chain used as the only step.
 *
 * The order is the substance here, and a gate can only see that there is one
 * implementation. These hold what it does.
