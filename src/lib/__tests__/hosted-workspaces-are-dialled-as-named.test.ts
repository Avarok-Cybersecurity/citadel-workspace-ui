/**
 * What Register sends for a hosted workspace is what the agent needs to reach it.
 *
 * Measured on the live site: joining `bench.work.avarok.net` sent
 * `bench.work.avarok.net:12349`, the agent dialled the Cloudflare edge over raw TCP, and
 * registration timed out. The agent turns a BARE tenant host into `wss://<host>/`
 * (server_address.rs) and dials a ws(s) URL as given, so both must reach it untouched.
