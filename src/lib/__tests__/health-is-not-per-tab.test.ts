/**
 * "Is the agent reachable" is a property of the browser, not of the tab.
 *
 * The health probe called `websocketService.isConnected()`, which asks whether
 * THIS tab owns a WASM client. There is one WebSocket per browser: the leader
 * owns the client and every follower proxies through it, with `client = null`
 * by design. So in the app's own documented multi-tab mode, every tab but one
 * reported the local agent unreachable, for ever, while everything worked --
 * a permanent red banner saying "Check that it is running" about an agent that
 * was running.
 *
 * `core.ts` already draws this distinction and its comment describes the exact
 * same bug in `fetchActiveSessions`. The rule existed; this caller never got it.
