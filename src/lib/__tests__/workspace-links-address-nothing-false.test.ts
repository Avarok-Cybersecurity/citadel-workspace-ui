/**
 * A workspace link must not claim to identify a workspace it cannot identify.
 *
 * Every path this module built carried `?id=<activeWorkspaceId>`. Nothing read
 * that parameter — the only ones anything in the app reads are `nodeId`,
 * `section`, `showP2P`, `channel`, `p2pUser` and `join` — and its value was
 * always the literal `'root'`, because `setActiveWorkspaceId` had no callers.
 * Both ends of the feature were absent; only the URL pollution was real.
 *
 * That made shared links actively wrong: `/workspace?id=root&nodeId=…` looks
 * like it addresses a specific workspace, so pasting one to a colleague in a
 * DIFFERENT workspace opened THEIR workspace with your node id.
