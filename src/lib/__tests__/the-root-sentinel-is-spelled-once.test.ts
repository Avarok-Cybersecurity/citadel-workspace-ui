/**
 * `workspace-root` is written once on each side, and the two sides agree.
 *
 * `workspace-constants.ts` says exactly why it exists:
 *
 *   It was written as a bare 'workspace-root' literal in several components,
 *   which is exactly the kind of duplication that survives a rename on the Rust
 *   side without anything failing to compile.
 *
 * The constant was added and the call sites were never converted. Six of them
 * were still bare literals — including the permission cache's hierarchy
 * fallback, which is what every inherited grant in the app resolves through.
 *
 * Two things are checked here, and they are different:
 *
 *  - nobody re-spells the literal, so a rename has one place to change;
 *  - the constant still equals the Rust sentinel, so that one place is right.
 *
 * The second is the one that matters. A single spelling that has drifted from
 * the server is a single spelling of the wrong thing.
