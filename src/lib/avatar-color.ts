/**
 * The one avatar colour rotation.
 *
 * There were three palettes — 7 colours in CreateGroupMembersTable, 8 in
 * GroupMemberManagementHelpers, 8 again in GroupMemberAvatars — and callers
 * picked whichever their neighbour imported. Since each rotates on
 * `index % length`, the same member came out one colour in the create-group
 * dialog and a different one in member management. Avatar colour is an identity
 * cue; a person changing colour between two screens quietly destroys it.
 *
 * Deliberately literal hex, and deliberately NOT theme tokens. These identify a
 * PERSON, not a semantic role, so they must stay stable when a workspace
 * changes its palette — the same reasoning that keeps the collaborator-cursor
 * colours literal. See docs/THEMING.md.
 *
 * Gold is gone from the rotation. It was first in two of the three lists and
 * commented "Owner", but both used it as an ordinary rotation entry, so any
 * member landing on index 0 was dressed as the owner. Role colour is an
 * explicit override, applied below, and is the only thing that should signal
 * rank.
