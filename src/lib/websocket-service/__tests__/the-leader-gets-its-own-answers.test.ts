/**
 * An answer to a request the leader sent comes back to the leader, whatever session it names.
 *
 * Seen on the live site: the leader claimed a follower tab's session on its new connection,
 * the agent answered `ConnectionManagementSuccess { cid: <follower's> }`, and — the leader's
 * own request id never having been tracked — the router fell back to CID routing and handed
 * the answer to the follower. The leader timed out on a claim that had succeeded, reported
 * it as failed, and retried.
 *
 * Mocked, because neither exists without a browser and an agent: the instance manager
 * (which tab leads, and who owns which CID) and the WebSocket client (a recorder). The
 * router and sendRequest are the real ones.
