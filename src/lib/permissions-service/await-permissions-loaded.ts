/**
 * Waiting for a permissions load to land, without leaking a listener.
 *
 * `off('user:permissions:loaded', handler)` was called only on the success
 * path. A fetch that timed out therefore left its listener on the global
 * emitter for the life of the tab — one per timed-out fetch, each holding its
 * closure and its `reject` alive, and each still running on every subsequent
 * permissions load for as long as the tab was open.
 *
 * Extracted because the lifetime is the whole substance: the handler has to be
 * declared before the timeout so the timeout can remove it, which reads as a
 * mistake inline and is the point here.
 *
 * It waits on `permissions:updated` -- "the cache now holds this domain" --
 * and NOT on `user:permissions:loaded`, which is only "a response arrived".
 *
 * The two are not the same moment. The service fills the cache from that
 * response synchronously when it can read the current user id without awaiting,
 * and inside a `.then` when it cannot -- a path whose own comment says it
 * exists because the synchronous accessor is null for a user who logged IN
 * rather than registering. So for anybody who logged in, the cache was filled a
 * tick after the event this used to wait on, and the read here had already
 * happened and rejected:
 *
 *   Error: Permissions not found in cache after load
 *
 * printed over and over in `test:prev-sessions`, which logs in. Even on the
 * synchronous path it worked only because the service's listener happened to be
 * registered first: waiting on "a response arrived" and then reading something
 * a different listener fills makes the answer depend on listener order.
