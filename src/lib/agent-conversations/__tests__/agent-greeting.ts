/**
 * The one stand-in every test needs for "which agent is this tab's socket
 * talking to": its greeting, and its answer to the declaration.
 *
 * `'older'` is an agent before 0.8.6, whose greeting has no `agent_ilm` and
 * which is never declared to: the browser-written store and the browser ILM.
 * `true` is a 0.8.6 agent that hosts the account. A test of the browser path
 * says which agent it is talking to, as production code learns it at start.
