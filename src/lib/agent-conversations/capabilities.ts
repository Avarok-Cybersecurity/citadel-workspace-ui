/**
 * Whether the agent hosts this browser's messaging (multi-window, agent 0.8.6+).
 *
 * An agent that does hosts each account's ILM and owns its conversation store
 * (citadel-workspace docs/plans/multi-window-sessions.md). It does so for a
 * connection that declares, with `ConnectionManagement::DeclareCapabilities
 * { agent_ilm: true }`, that it will run no ILM of its own. The answer,
 * `AgentCapabilities`, says whether it will.
 *
 * The agent says in its greeting -- the first message on every socket --
 * whether it can, so nothing waits on an agent that cannot: an older agent
 * does not answer a declaration at all, and its greeting has no `agent_ilm`.
 * An agent that offers is declared to and answers; one that offers and then
 * does not answer is broken, and the socket fails rather than guessing.
 *
 * The leader declares on its socket the moment the socket opens, BEFORE the
 * connection is reported up, so that no session is claimed on an undeclared
 * connection (the agent refuses that for a hosted account: "older page").
 * A follower has no socket; it asks the leader what its socket was told.
