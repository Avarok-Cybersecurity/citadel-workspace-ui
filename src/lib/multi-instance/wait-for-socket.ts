/**
 * Waiting briefly for a just-promoted leader's socket to exist.
 *
 * A tab that has won leadership is active before its socket is created, and
 * failing a proxied request in that window loses a real user operation to a
 * race they cannot see. It matters most in exactly the case that produces it: a
 * backgrounded leader has its heartbeat timer throttled by the browser to
 * roughly once a minute against a five second dead-leader timeout, so a
 * foreground follower challenges, briefly activates, and is demoted again by
 * the real leader's next event-driven reply — which is not throttled.
 *
 * Bounded, because holding indefinitely is the opposite mistake. With no socket
 * coming at all, an unbounded hold leaves the follower waiting out the queue's
 * retries rather than being told quickly that nobody is listening. The window
 * sits well under that retry deadline, so a flap resolves inside it and a
 * genuine absence still fails at about the time it always did.
 *
 * Polled rather than event-driven because the send function is registered by
 * assignment with no announcement, and adding an event for this would be a
 * second thing to keep in step with the first.
