/**
 * Delivering a message to the tab that OWNS its cid.
 *
 * The sibling of route-by-request-id.ts, split out for the same reason and
 * along the same seam: the two paths answer different questions — "who asked
 * for this?" versus "who is this addressed to?" — and confusing them is what
 * `CID_ROUTED_NOTIFICATIONS` exists to prevent.
 *
 * Returns whether the message was DELIVERED, which the leader's inbound handler
 * needs: it runs a second delivery path (`broadcastWorkspaceResponse`) for
 * anything this one did not place, and running both for the same message hands
 * the owning tab a duplicate. A duplicated group invite is a duplicated
 * auto-accept.
 *
 * `true` means every tab entitled to this message has it, or that dropping it
 * was the decision. `false` means something else still has to carry it.
