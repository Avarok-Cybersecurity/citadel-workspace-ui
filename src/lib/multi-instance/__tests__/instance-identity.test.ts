/**
 * Duplicate Tab copies sessionStorage, so a twin boots with a byte-identical
 * instance id. The channel's self-traffic filter then made the twins invisible
 * to each other — neither saw the other's heartbeat or election claim, both took
 * the "no heartbeat ever received" branch, and both became leader permanently:
 * two WebSockets from one browser, each claiming every session away from the
 * other, every directed message processed twice.
 *
 * No storage survives a reload but not a duplication, so identity cannot be made
 * collision-proof by choosing a different store. It has to be detected at
 * runtime, using the one marker the instance id cannot supply: a per-DOCUMENT
 * nonce that is never persisted.
