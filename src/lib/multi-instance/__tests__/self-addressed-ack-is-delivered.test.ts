/**
 * A tab can be the leader answering ITS OWN queued request: after a leader dies,
 * a follower holding a pending entry wins the election and the replay executes
 * locally instead of being posted.
 *
 * The ack for that went out over BroadcastChannel — which never delivers a
 * message to the posting context — so it vanished. The queue entry survived,
 * `checkTimeouts` re-fired it every 5s, and each retry RE-EXECUTED the request:
 * a Connect, a workspace mutation or a P2P message run up to four times, then
 * reported as failed when the caller's own 30s timer expired.
