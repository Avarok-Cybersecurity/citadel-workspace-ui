/**
 * A leader that cannot serve must yield.
 *
 * Promotion is handled by an `async` listener, and `eventEmitter.emit` invokes
 * handlers SYNCHRONOUSLY — so a rejection from `createWebSocketAsLeader`
 * escaped the emitter's own try/catch and nothing observed it. The tab stayed
 * `isLeader`, kept winning every subsequent election (tryBecomeLeader
 * short-circuits for an existing leader), and answered every request from every
 * tab in the browser with "WebSocket not ready" — permanently. There was no
 * self-demotion path: the yield branch only fires on a competing heartbeat,
 * which never arrives while this tab is broadcasting its own.
