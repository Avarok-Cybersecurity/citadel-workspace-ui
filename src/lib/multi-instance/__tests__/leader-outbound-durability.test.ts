/**
 * A leadership flap must not fail the requests it interrupts.
 *
 * A leader whose tab is backgrounded has its heartbeat `setInterval` throttled
 * by the browser to roughly once a minute, against a five-second dead-leader
 * timeout. So a foreground follower sees silence, claims leadership, activates
 * — and is demoted again milliseconds later by the real leader's event-driven
 * reply, which is not throttled. That flap repeats about every minute in the
 * multi-tab workflow this app is built around.
 *
 * Two things used to happen on every flap: the newly-"active" handler had no
 * socket yet and error-acked everything in flight, and the queue replayed
 * requests the old leader might still be executing.
