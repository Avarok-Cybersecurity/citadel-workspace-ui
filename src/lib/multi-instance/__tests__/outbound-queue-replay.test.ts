 * A request the user was already told had failed must not be silently re-sent.

 * never removed the entry from the queue, while the ACK path does call
 * `acknowledge`. `onLeaderChange` replays EVERY queued entry, so a Connect, a
 * workspace mutation or a P2P message that had already surfaced as a failure was
 * re-executed on a later connection, minutes or hours afterwards, and again at
 * every subsequent leader change — because nothing ever removed it.
