/**
 * The router reports whether it DELIVERED a message, and for group
 * notifications the answer is yes.
 *
 * `routeMessage` used to return nothing. The one caller that needed to know —
 * the leader's WebSocket handler, which runs a second delivery path
 * (`broadcastWorkspaceResponse`) alongside the router — decided instead by
 * asking whether the type was in `CID_ROUTED_NOTIFICATIONS`. That list was
 * written to stop request_id routing, and it holds nine entries; the internal
 * service defines seventeen notification variants. The seven group
 * notifications are all built with `request_id: None` and a recipient `cid`
 * (see `kernel/responses/group_event.rs` and `kernel/requests/mod.rs`), so the
 * router routes every one of them by CID — and the broadcast then sent each a
 * second time. The owning tab received every group invite, join request,
 * member-state change, leave, end and disconnect TWICE, and a duplicated
 * invite is a duplicated auto-accept.
 *
 * This file pins the router's half: for a group notification addressed to a
 * known instance, `routeMessage` forwards it and returns true. The caller's
 * half — that a true verdict suppresses the broadcast — is pinned in
 * websocket/__tests__/a-delivered-message-is-not-broadcast-again.test.ts.
