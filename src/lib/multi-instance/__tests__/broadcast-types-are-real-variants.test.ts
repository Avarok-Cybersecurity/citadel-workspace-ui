/**
 * Everything in `BROADCAST_MESSAGE_TYPES` is exempt from cid filtering — the

 * 'ServerResponse' sat on that list matching no variant of the generated
 * `InternalServiceResponse` union: dead as written, but a standing exemption
 * waiting for a future variant of that name to bypass the cid filter by
 * accident. The list now carries `satisfies ResponseType[]`, so a non-variant
 * entry fails to compile; these runtime pins are the half vitest can see.
