/**
 * A leadership flap must not execute the same outbound request twice.
 *
 * A backgrounded leader's heartbeat timer is throttled to roughly once a
 * minute against the five-second dead-leader timeout, so a foreground follower
 * claims leadership (`tryBecomeLeader`) while the sticky leader keeps it
 * (`handleLeaderElection` rule 1) until its rejection heartbeat lands. For
 * that window BOTH tabs hold `isLeader`, and `outbound-queue`'s leader-change
 * replay fires at exactly that moment — re-delivering entries the sticky
 * leader is still executing, un-acked only because the proxy handlers ack
 * after the work completes. The handler's `inFlight` set is per-tab, so the
 * transient leader re-executed workspace writes and Connects.
 *
 * These tests stage that window artificially: the sticky leader's side is
 * represented by its `request-executed` claim arriving on the channel, and the
 * transient leader's side by this tab activating and receiving the replay.
