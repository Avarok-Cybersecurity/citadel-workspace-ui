/**
 * Whether the leader's socket to the agent is up, as every tab sees it.
 *
 * Only the leader holds a socket; followers proxy through it. So when the
 * leader lost its socket, only the leader knew: a follower's health check
 * answered "can send" from `!isLeader` alone, and nothing in it heard the loss
 * or the recovery. The tab the user was looking at showed no agent-down banner
 * and no signed-out notice, and looked connected while its messages vanished.
 *
 * The leader reports each change here and broadcasts it (leader-reconnect.ts);
 * a follower applies what the leader broadcast (channel-message-dispatch.ts).
 * Either way, the change is re-emitted locally as 'agent-socket-state'.
