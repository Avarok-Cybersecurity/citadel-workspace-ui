/**
 * Pages that work without the local agent, and say so while they are mounted.
 *
 * The connection-retry dialog is right almost everywhere: nearly every screen
 * is useless without the agent, and that dialog is the one that carries the
 * download links. Creating a hosted workspace is the exception. It talks only
 * to the control plane over HTTPS, and the person doing it is, by definition,
 * someone who has probably not installed the agent yet -- on the hosted site
 * that is the first-run state, not an edge case. A modal telling them to
 * install something before they have even named their workspace would sit on
 * top of the one flow that does not need it; the claim screen offers the
 * download at the point it becomes necessary.
 *
 * WorkspaceApp sits above the router, so it cannot read the route. Instead the
 * page declares itself, and the dialog asks. A count rather than a flag, so two
 * such components mounted at once cannot un-declare each other.
