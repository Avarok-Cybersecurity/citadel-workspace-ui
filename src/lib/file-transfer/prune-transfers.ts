/**
 * What the persisted transfer history keeps, and what it lets go.
 *
 * `persistTransfer` read the whole `citadel:file-transfers` map, replaced one
 * entry and wrote the whole map back — on every state change of every transfer,
 * including each progress tick. Nothing ever removed an entry. So the cost of
 * saving one transfer's progress grew with the number of transfers the browser
 * had ever seen, and the map grew for the life of the profile.
 *
 * Neither end of that is dramatic on its own; together they end at a
 * localStorage quota error, in a `catch {}` whose comment says losing the
 * record "costs history, not a transfer" — which stops being true once the
 * write that fails is the one recording a transfer still in flight.
 *
 * A finished transfer is history. It is worth keeping for a while, so a bubble
 * from this morning still renders with its state, and it is worth dropping
 * eventually.
