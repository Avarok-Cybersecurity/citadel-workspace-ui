/**
 * Building the in-band message that tells the recipient a transfer exists.
 *
 * A transfer has two halves. The bytes go over the protocol's own file transfer
 * (SendFile), which raises a FileTransferRequestNotification on the recipient's
 * internal service. The BUBBLE in the conversation comes from somewhere else
 * entirely: an ordinary P2P message carrying a FileTransferRequest messaging
 * layer, which the recipient's FileTransferMessageHandler turns into a
 * `message_type: 'file_transfer'` entry in the conversation.
 *
 * Only the first half was ever sent. `createFileTransferRequest` — the builder
 * for the second — had no caller, so recipients got bytes and no bubble, and in
 * async mode no indication at all: the code there notes the recipient "discovers
 * the transfer via the message-protocol path", which is precisely the message
 * that was never sent.
 *
 * Kept separate from io.ts so the decision of what to announce can be tested
 * without a socket.
