/**
 * Joining the two halves of an incoming transfer.
 *
 * A transfer arrives as two independent events, and they name it differently:
 *
 *   - the BYTES come over the protocol's own SendFile, which raises a
 *     `FileTransferRequestNotification` carrying a numeric `object_id`;
 *   - the BUBBLE comes as an ordinary P2P message carrying a
 *     `FileTransferRequest` layer with a `transfer_id` — a `crypto.randomUUID()`
 *     minted by the sender.
 *
 * Accept and decline go back over the PROTOCOL, so they must name the
 * `object_id`. `registerTransferMapping` was written to bridge the two id
 * spaces and had no callers, so nothing ever populated the map — and the accept
 * path passed the UUID straight to `BigInt()`, which throws `SyntaxError`
 * synchronously while building the request. `RespondFileTransfer` was therefore
 * never sent for ANY incoming transfer: the protocol offer was never accepted,
 * the bytes never landed, and the user saw "Failed to accept file" with a raw
 * BigInt parse error as the description.
 *
 * The two events race, so correlation has to work in both orders. There is no
 * shared id to join on — that is the whole problem — so we join on what both
 * sides independently describe: the sender, the file name and the exact byte
 * size.
