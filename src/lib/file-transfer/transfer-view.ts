/**
 * What a file-transfer bubble shows, decided in one place.
 *
 * The bubble rendered `message.transfer_state` — the state stamped on the
 * conversation entry when the offer arrived. That entry is what the page store
 * persists and restores, and nothing writes later states back into it, so
 * after a reload every offer came back as 'pending' with a live Accept button:
 * hours-old offers the browser could no longer answer (the object_id join is
 * in memory and the agent does not re-announce), whose Accept threw "Transfer
 * not found". The service's record is the authority on a transfer's state and
 * its reason, so it wins whenever it exists.
 *
 * It also carries the reason. A failed transfer's record holds the Fail tick's
 * message, but the bubble read `message.error`, which nothing sets — so it said
 * "Transfer failed" and never why.
