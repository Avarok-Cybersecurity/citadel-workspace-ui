/**
 * A send's progress reaches its own bubble, and nothing else's.
 *
 * Live (Mac -> Windows, P2P): the receiver saved the file while the sender's
 * bubble stayed on "Sending... 0%". Sender-side ticks carried no id of their
 * own -- the agent stamped them with the session's TCP uuid -- so they were
 * placed by guessing: the OLDEST open outgoing transfer to that peer. A
 * "standard" offer that never resolved ('staged' for ever, see the accept path)
 * is exactly such a transfer, and it took the new send's ticks and completion.
 * And once a peer had stored a file here, the RE-VFS reception filed the same
 * TCP uuid as foreign, after which every send's ticks were dropped outright.
 *
 * The agent now names the SendFile on every sender tick, and names nothing on
 * a stream nobody here requested. These pin the browser's half.
