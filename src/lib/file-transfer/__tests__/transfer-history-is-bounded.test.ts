/**
 * The persisted transfer map must not grow for the life of the profile.
 *
 * `persistTransfer` reads the whole `citadel:file-transfers` map, replaces one
 * entry and writes the whole map back — on every state change, including each
 * progress tick. Nothing removed an entry, so the cost of recording one
 * transfer's progress grew with every transfer the browser had ever seen, and
 * the map grew without limit.
 *
 * The end of that is a localStorage quota error inside a `catch {}` whose
 * comment says losing the record costs history and not a transfer — true only
 * while the map is bounded. Unbounded, the write that finally fails is the one
 * recording a transfer still in flight, and the bubble loses the record that
 * Accept, Decline and Cancel need.
