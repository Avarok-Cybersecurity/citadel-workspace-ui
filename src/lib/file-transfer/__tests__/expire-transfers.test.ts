/**
 * A file offer that lapses must stop looking live.
 *
 * `expiresAt` was stamped on every offer and shipped to the peer, the
 * `'expired'` state existed in the union, and the bubble had a "Request
 * expired" branch — and nothing ever wrote that state. So a sender who went
 * offline mid-offer left the recipient a live-looking Accept button for ever,
 * and pressing it started a transfer nobody was on the other end of.
 *
 * Three pieces of one feature, each shipped, never joined.
