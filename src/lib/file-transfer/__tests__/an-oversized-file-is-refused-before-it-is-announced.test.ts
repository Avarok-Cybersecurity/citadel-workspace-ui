/**
 * Sending an over-cap file announced the offer and then threw.
 *
 * `executeSendTransferRequest` announced the transfer to the recipient FIRST
 * and only then handed the bytes to the router, whose inline-payload cap threw
 * on any browser File above it. The recipient was left a live-looking 7-day
 * offer for bytes that would never arrive, and the sender a 'pending' record
 * nothing ever errored — the exact half-action already fixed for empty files
 * (see an-empty-file-is-refused-before-it-is-announced.test.ts); the size
 * guard never migrated ahead of the announcement.
 *
 * Compounding it, TWO constants governed the same inline ByteContents wire
 * format: a private 2 MiB cap in send-operations and the 16 MiB service mirror
 * in server-upload (the internal service's requests/file/upload.rs is the
 * authority at 16 MiB). So a 3 MiB file staged fine in async mode and died
 * post-announcement in p2p mode. One constant now; the guard here uses it.
