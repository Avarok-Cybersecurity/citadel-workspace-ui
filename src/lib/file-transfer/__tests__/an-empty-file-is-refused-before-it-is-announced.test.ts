/**
 * Sending a 0-byte file announced the offer and then threw.
 *
 * `send-operations` gates the inline path on `params.source instanceof File &&
 * params.source.size > 0`; a zero-byte File falls through to the else and throws
 * "requires ... a non-empty browser File object". That throw landed AFTER
 * `announceTransfer`, which is the message that makes the transfer appear in the
 * recipient's conversation.
 *
 * So the recipient got an offer for bytes that would never arrive — a bubble
 * they could neither accept (nothing to fetch) nor usefully decline — and the
 * sender's transfer sat on 'pending' until its TTL expired. An action that half
 * happened, reported as neither success nor failure.
 *
 * Refused at the entry now, before the transfer record exists and long before
 * anything is announced. Supporting empty files instead would mean confirming
 * the service accepts an empty ByteContents payload; that is a backend question,
 * and guessing at it here is how the half-action got shipped.
