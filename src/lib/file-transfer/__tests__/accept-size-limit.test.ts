/**
 * "Max file size to accept" must limit what you accept.
 *
 * The setting is labelled that way in Chat Settings and was read at exactly
 * one site: the SEND path. So a user who lowered the slider to protect
 * themselves carried on receiving files of any size — and with auto-accept on,
 * without being asked. A receiver had no way to limit what arrived, while the
 * control read as protective.
