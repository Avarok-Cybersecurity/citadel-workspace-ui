/**
 * One browser's accounts must not share a transfer history.
 *
 * Settings were given account scoping — `scopedSettingsKey` exists and its
 * comment says why: "two accounts in one browser talking to the same peer must
 * not share a max-file-size or an auto-accept switch". The transfer STORE was
 * left on a single global `citadel:file-transfers` key, so every tab loaded
 * every account's history and each write re-serialised all of it. Two accounts
 * in one browser is the ordinary case in this product, not an edge one.
 *
 * The same guarded/unguarded twin that produced most of this codebase's
 * defects, one file apart from the guard that names the hazard.
