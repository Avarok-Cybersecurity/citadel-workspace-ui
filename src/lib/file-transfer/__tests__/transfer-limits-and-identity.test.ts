/**
 * Three severed joints in one feature.
 *
 * The chat file-transfer paths were each meticulously repaired around a break
 * that was one hop further along:
 *
 *  - Accept/decline sent `cid: 0` with the comment "Not used for message-based".
 *    The internal service looks the connection up by exactly that field, and
 *    nothing is filed under 0, so every response came back "Connection not
 *    found" -- on a fire-and-forget send that checked nothing, with `cid: 0` on
 *    the failure so CID routing could not deliver it to a tab either. No chat
 *    transfer ever moved a byte.
 *  - The default "Recommended" async mode sent `cid: null` for a non-nullable
 *    u64, so the request failed deserialization in the WASM client and never
 *    left the browser.
 *  - The max-file-size setting was written under `"{ownCid}:{peerCid}"` and read
 *    under the bare peer CID, so both the send-time and accept-time checks
 *    always saw the 100 MiB default and the slider limited nothing.
