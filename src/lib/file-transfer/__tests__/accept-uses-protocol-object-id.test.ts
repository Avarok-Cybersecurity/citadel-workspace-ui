/**
 * Accepting an incoming transfer must name the PROTOCOL's object_id.
 *
 * A transfer arrives as two events with two different names for it: the bytes
 * come over SendFile carrying a numeric `object_id`, and the bubble comes as a
 * P2P message carrying a `crypto.randomUUID()`. Accept goes back over the
 * protocol, so it has to name the object_id.
 *
 * It passed the UUID through to `BigInt(params.protocolId)`, which throws
 * SyntaxError synchronously while the request literal is built — before
 * anything is sent. `RespondFileTransfer` was therefore never issued for ANY
 * incoming transfer: the offer was never accepted and the bytes never landed.
 *
 * This test drives the REAL FileTransferIO and mocks only the socket. The
 * existing accept test mocks `io` wholesale, which is exactly why this survived
 * — the mock stood precisely where the defect was.
