/**
 * Per-peer transfer settings are read back from localStorage, written by
 * whatever version of the app the user last ran. Returning that blob verbatim
 * means any field added since arrives `undefined` — `allowRevfsStorage` reads as
 * off, silently disabling RE-VFS for that peer, and `revfsQuota` renders as
 * `NaN` MB in the settings UI.
 *
 * The settings tabs elsewhere in the app already spread over their defaults;
 * this one returned `stored` directly. The test is written against a
 * deliberately-old shape, which is the only thing that can distinguish the two.
