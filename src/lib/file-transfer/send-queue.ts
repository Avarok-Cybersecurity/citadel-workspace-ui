/**
 * Sending a file to a peer who is offline: it waits, then goes by itself.
 *
 * A send to an unreachable peer used to wait 15 s for a channel and then fail
 * at the agent ("Peer Connection Not Found"). Now it is held as a 'queued'
 * transfer -- the same record and state machine as every other transfer -- and
 * the outgoing bubble says "Will send when {name} is online". When the peer's
 * channel opens it is sent the ordinary way.
 *
 * The decisions are here and pure; holding the File (in memory and IndexedDB,
 * so it survives a reload) and noticing the peer come back are behind ports
 * (send-queue-io.ts).
