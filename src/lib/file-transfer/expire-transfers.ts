/**
 * Letting a file offer go stale, which nothing did.

 * branch — and nothing ever wrote that state. `FILE_TRANSFER_EXPIRY_CHECK_
 * INTERVAL_MS` had zero usages.
 *
 * So a sender who goes offline mid-offer leaves the recipient a live-looking
 * Accept button for ever. Pressing it starts a transfer nobody is on the other
 * end of, which then sits at "Downloading…" until the tab is closed. Three
 * pieces of a feature, built, shipped and never joined.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function so the decision is testable without a clock, a
 * service or a peer.
