/**
 * Business logic for the PROTOCOL plane's progress/completion notifications —
 * the plane that actually moves bytes (SendFile / RespondFileTransfer /
 * FileTransferTickNotification, backed by the Rust internal service).
 *
 * The router (real-protocol-io-router.ts) resolves a tick to an exact
 * transferId whenever the wire allows it. When it cannot — sender-side
 * streams carry no id of any kind, see tick-events.ts — the event arrives
 * here with only (cid, peerCid, direction), and we fall back to matching the
 * oldest live transfer for that peer pair and direction.
 *
 * Wire limitation, stated plainly: two CONCURRENT sends to the same peer are
 * indistinguishable on the sender's side. Their ticks interleave onto
 * whichever transfer is oldest, and the first completion tick closes it. The
 * fix belongs in the internal service (thread object_id through
 * ObjectTransferStatus); until then this is the best the browser can know.
