/**
 * Peer-signal handlers for the message plane that REMAINS in use.
 *
 * This module once held a whole second transfer implementation — base64
 * chunking over P2P messages, with streaming, reassembly and its own progress
 * events. That plane was never wired: nothing ever emitted a
 * FileTransferChunk/Progress message (their constructors had zero callers), so
 * the handlers were subscribed decoys and the real bytes always travelled over
 * the protocol's own SendFile. The dead plane has been deleted; the protocol
 * plane's progress/completion now drives state via protocol-transfer-events.ts.
 *
 * What stays is the one in-band signal the protocol cannot express: CANCEL.
 * The SDK has no cancel command (cancellation is implicit in disconnect), so
 * the cancelling side sends a FileTransferCancel message (in-band-signals.ts)
 * and this handler moves the peer's bubble to its terminal state.
