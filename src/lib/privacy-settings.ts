/**
 * The user's privacy choices, as a source the code that must obey them can read.
 *
 * These lived entirely inside `PrivacySettingsTab`: it wrote them to
 * localStorage and dispatched a `privacy-settings-changed` event that nothing
 * subscribed to. No field was read anywhere outside the tab that wrote it. On a
 * product whose pitch is that the user controls their own data, "Send read
 * receipts: off" still sent receipts and "Show typing indicators: off" still
 * showed them.
 *
 * Four settings are honoured from here. The rest live elsewhere, and saying
 * where is part of the fix:
 *
 * - `acceptRequestsFromStrangers` is enforced where the decision is made: this
 *   client answers an incoming P2P registration request, and a stranger's is
 *   declined (p2p-registration-service/incoming-request-policy.ts). A copy is
 *   published on the member record only so the refused requester can be told
 *   why; the decision never reads that copy.
 * - Profile visibility is NOT here. The avatar, email and title are served by
 *   the workspace server, so only the server can withhold them; the choice is
 *   stored on the user's record there (lib/profile-privacy.ts).
 * - `notifyOnScreenshot` is not observable from a web page at all.
 *
 * `acceptRequestsFromStrangers` replaced `allowDirectMessages`, a three-way
 * select that could not be changed (it was disabled) but was saved on every
 * visit to the tab. A new name, so a stored value nobody chose cannot start
 * refusing requests.
