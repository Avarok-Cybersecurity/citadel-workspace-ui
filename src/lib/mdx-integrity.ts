/**
 * Document integrity: the bytes that reach the renderer must be the bytes the
 * server stored.
 *
 * Rendering a workspace document means EXECUTING it — `@mdx-js/mdx` compiles
 * the MDX to JavaScript and runs it — and the production CSP now grants
 * `'unsafe-eval'` so that this works at all. That is a deliberate decision, and
 * this is its compensating control: the server hashes `mdx_content` on every
 * write, the client re-hashes before executing, and a mismatch refuses to run.
 *
 * Be exact about the boundary, because a control believed to cover more than it
 * does is worse than none:
 *
 *  - It DOES catch the document being altered between the server and the
 *    renderer — a corrupted IndexedDB cache, a store-layer bug, another tab
 *    writing over the content, a truncated response.
 *  - It does NOT stop an attacker who already has script execution on the page.
 *    They can patch this function, or alter content and hash together.
 *  - It says NOTHING about whether the document was hostile when it was
 *    written. A member with edit rights who writes malicious MDX gets a
 *    perfectly matching hash. That risk is inherent in executing
 *    member-authored documents at all, and is the reason the sandboxed
 *    alternatives exist.
 *
 * The hash rule must match `citadel_workspace_types::structs::mdx_content_hash`
 * exactly: hex-encoded SHA-256 of the UTF-8 bytes, with NO normalisation. The
 * Rust side has a test pinning the published SHA-256 of "abc"; so does this, so
 * neither can drift into agreeing only with itself.
