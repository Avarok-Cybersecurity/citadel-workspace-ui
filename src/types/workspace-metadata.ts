/**
 * Exact types for the workspace `metadata` field.
 *
 * The wire type is `Workspace.metadata: Vec<u8>`, which ts-rs surfaces as
 * `number[]`. The context declared it `Record<string, any>` instead, and that
 * was not merely loose — it was wrong, and it broke something:
 * `getWorkspaceLogo` tested `metadata.logo` on what is actually a byte array, so
 * the property was always undefined and the image branch was unreachable. Every
 * workspace fell back to initials, and no type error was possible because `any`
 * accepts the lookup.
 *
 * Naming the real shape once removes the whole class: a byte array cannot be
 * dotted into by mistake, and a decoder has to say what it is decoding.
