/**
 * An error toast must be announced, and must be findable.
 *
 * Sonner renders every toast inside one `aria-live="polite"` region, so an
 * error waited for the user to pause before being read — and an error that
 * blocks the action they just took is exactly the case for `assertive`. The app
 * already uses `role="alert"` for the equivalent inline errors.
 *
 * It also closes a trap this repository fell into twice while writing the
 * agent-down checks, and had already written down: a Sonner toast carries no
 * `role="alert"`, so an assertion looking for one reports "the app said
 * nothing" about an app that said exactly the right thing. Documenting it did
 * not stop it happening again; making the selector true does.
