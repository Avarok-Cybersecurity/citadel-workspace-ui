/**
 * Coming back to a node you already opened must not say the room is empty.
 *
 * `member-list-loading.spec.ts` failed all three attempts on master and blocked
 * `publish`, which is the job that builds the images production runs. Its own
 * instrumentation refuted the standing hypothesis: exactly ONE `members:loaded`
 * arrived, `{payloadDomainId: workspace-root, activeDomainId: workspace-root,
 * count: 3}`. The load never ended empty, so "an empty payload ended the load"
 * — the theory two previous fixes were aimed at — is wrong.
 *
 * What is left is the pair of values the sidebar branches on disagreeing:
 *
 *   - `loadedForDomain` was set to A when A's members arrived, and NOTHING ever
 *     unset it.
 *   - `members` was cleared by the domain-change effect.
 *
 * So on A -> B -> A, the hook reports `loadedForDomain === activeDomainId`
 * (hence "not loading") while holding an empty list, and `MemberListBody`
 * renders "Nobody else is here yet" about a workspace with three members.
 *
 * Two facts made this hard to see, and both are why the assertion below is
 * shaped the way it is:
 *
 *   1. The spec's DOM capture runs one `evaluate` AFTER the sighting, so it
 *      reported "loading" for a frame that had shown "empty" — the diagnostic
 *      described the state that replaced the defect, not the defect.
 *   2. It is a one-frame window. Reading `result.current` after `renderHook`
 *      measures the settled state, which is correct either way; the sibling
 *      test not-yet-loaded-is-not-empty.test.tsx records the same lesson.
 *
 * So this records the pair on EVERY render and asserts the invariant across all
 * of them.
