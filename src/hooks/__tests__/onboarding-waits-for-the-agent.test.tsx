/**
 * The intent dialog must not open on top of the dialog explaining why nothing
 * works yet.
 *
 * On the hosted UI this is the FIRST-RUN state rather than an edge case. The
 * page is served from work.avarok.net; the agent runs on the visitor's own
 * machine; until they install it, `wss://local.avarok.net:12345` refuses.
 * Verified against production: clicking "Create Account" put the intent dialog
 * on screen underneath `ConnectionRetryModal`, while `OfflineBanner` said the
 * same thing across the top. Three notices for one condition, two of them
 * modal, each with its own focus trap.
 *
 * `ConnectionRetryModal` is the one that must win — it alone carries the agent
 * download links and the command to run it.
 *
 * The two directions are pinned separately on purpose. "Does not open while
 * unreachable" alone would pass for a hook that never opens at all, which is
 * the failure this whole feature is; "opens when healthy" alone would pass for
 * the stacking behaviour that shipped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE. `useServiceHealth` starts optimistic and only
 * learns otherwise from a `service-health` event, which `healthCheckService`
 * emits on a 10-second poll. So a click in the first seconds of a page load can
 * still open the dialog before the first poll reports. The third test is the
 * one that covers that window: the dialog CLOSES when health arrives, rather
 * than staying up under the retry modal. Closing the window entirely would mean
 * driving this from the connection-retry state itself, which lives in
 * `useConnectionHandler` inside WorkspaceApp and is not reachable from Landing
 * without new plumbing. Stated here rather than implied, because a guard whose
 * reach is assumed wider than it is stops anyone looking again.
