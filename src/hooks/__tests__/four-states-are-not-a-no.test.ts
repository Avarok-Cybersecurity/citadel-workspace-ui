/**
 * Four states are not the answer "no", and each was learned from a surface
 * that had refused somebody something they were entitled to.
 *
 *   allowed     — yes.
 *   loading     — nobody has answered yet.
 *   unanswered  — the retry budget ran out; a failed request, not a refusal.
 *   !answered   — no answer for this domain is stored at all. `hasPermission`
 *                 reports that as `false`, indistinguishable from a refusal.
 *
 * Spelling them at each call site is how they drifted: the office composer had
 * three of the four and withheld itself from every user in a three-user run,
 * the theme editor had two and could show a workspace's own owner a read-only
 * editor, and `BaseOffice` had none and disabled Edit for anyone whose
 * permissions had not loaded.
