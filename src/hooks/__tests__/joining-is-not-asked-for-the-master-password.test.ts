/**
 * Answering "I am joining" must stop the master-password prompt.
 *
 * The onboarding dialog collects an `'admin' | 'member'` answer and, until now,
 * threw it away: `onChoose` and `onDismiss` were both wired to the same
 * zero-argument `resolve`, so choosing "setting up a new workspace", choosing
 * "joining a workspace someone else set up", and closing the dialog were
 * literally indistinguishable. A member was then shown
 * WorkspaceInitializationModal — which asks for WORKSPACE_MASTER_PASSWORD, a
 * secret they have no way to obtain — one screen after the dialog had promised
 * them they "should not be asked for it".
 *
 * These assert the three answers are now three different outcomes. The `admin`
 * and dismiss cases are as important as the `member` one: a suppression that
 * fires for everybody is the same defect wearing the opposite sign, and it would
 * hide the prompt from the one person who is supposed to see it.
