/**
 * Opening a group chat was a perpetual render-and-write loop.
 *
 * `markAsRead` used `prev.map(...)`, which always allocates. The store's only
 * no-op guard is identity — `if (next === groups) return` — so every call, even
 * one that changed nothing, notified every subscriber and fired an IndexedDB
 * write. The group page calls it from an effect whose deps include `getGroup`,
 * whose identity derives from `groups`. New array, new getGroup, effect re-runs,
 * call again: a hot tab, or React's "Maximum update depth exceeded", depending
 * on scheduling.
 *
 * The test asserts the store fact the loop hung from — that a mark-as-read with
 * nothing to mark does not produce a new array — rather than trying to observe a
 * render loop, which is exactly the kind of thing a test can watch not happen
 * for the wrong reason.
