/**
 * Group Conversations State — the React face of the shared group store.
 *
 * State and event handling live in lib/group-conversations/group-store, ONCE
 * for the whole app. This hook only subscribes. It used to own both, per
 * instance: the sidebar's copy had the groups, the group page's fresh copy had
 * none, and opening a group you were just invited to bounced you straight back
 * to the workspace with "Group not found". See the store header for why the
 * localStorage bridge between those copies never actually persisted anything.
