/**
 * Checking one permission for one domain, with a loading state and a reason.
 *
 * There were three of these — `usePermission`, `useAnyPermission`,
 * `useAllPermissions` — with byte-identical bodies apart from the predicate and
 * the sentence in `reason`. Neither of the plural two had a single caller.
 *
 * The duplication was already load-bearing before anyone used it.
 * `useResetOnRoleChange` below fixes a real defect: `clearCache()` on a
 * promotion left every hook with an empty cache AND a guard saying it had
 * already asked, so every gated control stayed denied until a reload. That fix
 * had to be written into all three, and the next fix in this file would have
 * had to be as well — with two of the three copies never exercised, so a
 * mistake in them could not be noticed.
 *
 * Deleted rather than deduplicated behind a predicate argument. Any/all are a
 * parameter away if something ever needs them, and speculative generality is
 * how three copies came to exist.
