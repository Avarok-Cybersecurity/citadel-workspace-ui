/**
 * Who is signed in on THIS tab, for components that render their name.
 *
 * The lookup order is `tabIdentity`'s and the reason is recorded there: the
 * tab's selection first, the saved account second. What this adds is the
 * asynchronous read, which `BaseOffice` and `GroupChatPage` were each about to
 * spell out by hand — and a hand-spelled copy of an ordering that matters is
 * how the ordering drifts.
 *
 * Returns `null` until the read lands. Callers should render something during
 * that, not nothing: `GroupChatPage` gated its entire chat area on an identity
 * lookup and showed an empty page whenever the lookup came back empty.
