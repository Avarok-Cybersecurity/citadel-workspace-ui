/**
 * Toasts.
 *
 * The app previously mounted TWO toast systems at once — shadcn's `<Toaster />`
 * (backed by a hand-rolled reducer in this file) and `<Sonner />` — so which
 * visual style a notification got depended on which feature raised it: 33 files
 * used `useToast()`, while the file manager imported `toast` from `sonner`
 * directly. Same product, two different-looking notifications.
 *
 * This module now keeps the `useToast()` / `toast({ title, description })` call
 * shape those 33 files already use, but renders through Sonner. One system, no
 * call-site churn, and the shadcn toast/toaster components are gone.

 * The DESCRIPTION carries the alert, not the headline. Wrapping the headline
 * was the first attempt and it cost the description entirely -- Sonner renders
 * no description when its message is a ReactNode, so the toast shrank to
 * "Connection Error" and dropped the sentence telling the user what to do. The
 * agent-down gate caught it on the next run.
 *
 * Sonner renders its toasts inside a single `aria-live="polite"` region, so an
 * error waited for the user to pause before being read -- and an error that
 * blocks the action they just took is the case for `assertive`. The app already
 * uses `role="alert"` for the equivalent inline errors.
 *
 * It also closes a trap this repository has fallen into twice, and had already
 * written down: a Sonner toast carries no `role="alert"`, so an assertion
 * looking for one reports "the app said nothing" about an app that said exactly
 * the right thing. Documenting that did not stop it happening again. Making the
 * selector true does.
 *
 * Only for errors. Success and neutral toasts are ambient and interrupting a
 * screen-reader user with them is the opposite of helpful.
