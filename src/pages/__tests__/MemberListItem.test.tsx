/**
 * This row was a div with an onClick and no role, so the profile panel beside it
 * — which says "Click on a user or search to view their profile" — could only be
 * filled from the search box. Making the whole row role="button" then created a
 * second problem: a control containing two more controls, which screen readers
 * do not present consistently.
 *
 * The shape that works is one button for the identity and the actions as its
 * siblings. That is a structural property, so it is worth asserting structurally
 * rather than by driving a browser.
