/**
 * Connecting to a chosen server from the Connect page.
 *
 * This page is where `WorkspaceLoader` sends a user whose connection died — it
 * is the app's designated recovery route. It could not recover anyone.
 *
 * The only authenticated branch tested `session.cid` on the STORED session, but
 * `ConnectionManager.initialize` deliberately clears every stored CID on each
 * load ("Clearing stored CIDs to force fresh connection") and persists that. So
 * after any page load the branch was dead, and the fallthrough navigated into
 * the workspace with no session at all: the loader found zero active sessions,
 * its 5s timer fired, and it sent the user back here. A silent five-second
 * bounce, repeatable forever, at exactly the moment they were already stuck.
 *
 * What actually recovers a user is the live session list on the internal
 * service, which is where a surviving session lives after a page reload — the
 * same list `useOrphanSessions` claims from. If nothing is there, auto-connect
 * is asked to re-establish one from stored credentials. Only if BOTH fail does
 * this give up, and then it says so and routes to sign-in rather than into a
 * workspace that will bounce them straight back.
