/**
 * The peer a directory member corresponds to, or why they cannot be reached.
 *
 * A member is identified by USERNAME; registration needs a CID. Only the peer
 * list carries both, so a member who has never appeared there cannot be reached
 * — and saying so is better than sending nothing and reporting success.
 *
 * `null` for the list is a third answer and not the second one. It means
 * discovery never succeeded, and telling somebody their colleague "needs to be
 * online at least once" when the truth is that we could not ask sends them to
 * wait for something that has probably already happened.
 *
 * Throws rather than returning a result type because every caller turns the
 * failure into the same toast, and the message IS the product behaviour here.
