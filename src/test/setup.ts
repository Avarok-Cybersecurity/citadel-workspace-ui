 * jsdom does not implement matchMedia.

 * throws "window.matchMedia is not a function" on render without this. Shimmed
 * in the environment rather than mocked per component, because it is a gap in
 * jsdom rather than something about our code, and stubbing it inside a test
 * would mean testing a component with its responsive behaviour removed.
 *
 * Reports "not matching", i.e. the desktop branch of every query. A test that
 * cares about the mobile branch should override this for itself, so that
 * intent is visible in the test rather than assumed from a default here.

 * as an unhandled error and explicitly warns can cause false positives: the test
 * still passes while an exception escapes mid-interaction.
 *
 * No-ops rather than a real implementation. Capture only affects where
 * subsequent pointer events are routed, and jsdom dispatches directly to the
 * target anyway, so nothing under test depends on the behaviour — only on the
