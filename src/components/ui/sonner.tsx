/**
 * Toasts, positioned so they do not sit on top of the button you were about to
 * press.
 *
 * At 375px the "Ready to work offline" toast occupied 559-651px and the join
 * form's submit button 572-607px: `document.elementFromPoint` at the centre of
 * "Join" returned the toast. The last button of first-run registration was not
 * clickable while an ambient notice was on screen, and nothing failed -- the
 * button was present, visible, enabled and named, and a tap landed on the
 * notice.
 *
 * Bottom-right is fine on a desktop, where a toast lands in empty margin. On a
 * phone there is no margin: the toast spans the width and the primary action is
 * at the bottom of the form. So on small viewports they come from the top.
 *
 * And then they landed on the TOP BAR. A CI probe at 375px reported the account
 * avatar `on screen | covered by li.group` -- a Sonner toast, which renders each
 * toast as an `<li>` whose first class is `group`. While any toast was up, the
 * only route to Profile, Settings and Sign Out was untappable on a phone.
 *
 * Moving a collision is not fixing one. The mobile offset now clears the fixed
 * header, reading the height from the variable AppLayout writes rather than
 * repeating the number -- `3.5rem` is already spelled in four places, and a
 * fifth copy would drift the moment the header changed.
