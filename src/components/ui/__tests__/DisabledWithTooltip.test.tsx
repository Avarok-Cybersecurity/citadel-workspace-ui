/**
 * These wrappers grey a control out and set `pointer-events: none`. CSS does not
 * stop the keyboard, so before the fix the button inside stayed focusable and
 * Enter still fired its onClick — a permission-gated action was fully operable
 * by anyone not using a mouse, and reported isEnabled() as true.
 *
 * Guarded here rather than in an integration spec because the defect is a single
 * attribute on a single element, and a unit test can say so in milliseconds.
