/**
 * On a phone, toasts must not come from the bottom.
 *
 * Measured at 375px: the "Ready to work offline" toast occupied 559–651px and
 * the join form's submit button 572–607px, so `document.elementFromPoint` at the
 * centre of "Join" returned the toast. The last button of first-run registration
 * could not be pressed while an ambient notice was up — and nothing failed. The
 * button was present, visible, enabled, correctly named and above the tap-size
 * floor. Only a hit test sees it.
 *
 * `check-mobile-layout.mjs` now hit-tests every control, which catches this
 * class in general — but only while a toast happens to be on screen, and the
 * ambient ones fire on a schedule no gate can force. So the arrangement itself
 * is asserted here: bottom on a desktop, where a toast lands in empty margin;
 * top on a phone, where there is no margin and the primary action is at the
 * bottom of the form.
