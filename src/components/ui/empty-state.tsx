/**
 * What a list says when it has nothing in it.

 * A list that renders zero rows and no explanation reads as a broken screen:
 * the user cannot tell "nobody is here yet" from "this failed to load" from
 * "your filter excludes everything", and there is nothing to click. Each of
 * those needs a different sentence and, where one exists, a different action.
