/**
 * A slider whose THUMB carries the accessible name.
 *
 * Radix puts `role="slider"` on the Thumb, not the Root, so a `<Label
 * htmlFor>` pointing at the Root names nothing a screen reader can use:
 * `htmlFor` only labels labelable elements, and the Root is a div. axe reports
 * `aria-input-field-name`, serious — "ARIA input fields must have an accessible
 * name" — and it is the control the user is trying to operate that has none.
 *
 * Found on the Font Size slider in Settings → Theme, which is reachable with no
 * account at all, and it applies to every slider in the app: the label sits
 * beside the Root in both call sites.
 *
 * `label` is REQUIRED rather than optional. An optional accessibility prop is
 * one nobody passes -- that is how this happened -- and there is no slider
 * anywhere that legitimately has no name.
