 * A styled confirmation that can be awaited from a hook.
 *
 * The app already had ConfirmDeleteDialog, but it is driven by `open` state, so
 * only a component could use it. Logic living in hooks — the file manager's
 * delete handlers, for one — reached for `window.confirm` instead: an unstyled
 * OS dialog in the middle of an otherwise designed app, which also blocks the
 * event loop and, incidentally, hangs any browser automation that has not
 * registered a dialog handler.
 *
 * This keeps the shape of the call the hooks were already making —
 * `if (!(await confirm({ ... }))) return;` — so the branch that reads as
 * "ask, then act" stays legible.
