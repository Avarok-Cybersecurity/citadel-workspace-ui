/**
 * Which of the saved accounts are currently connected — and whether that is

 *
 * `null` means the query has not answered. It is NOT the same as "none", and
 * the dialog rendered it as if it were: `getActiveSessions()` returns an empty
 * array when the socket is down or the request times out, so a transient
 * failure made the Active Sessions section vanish and stripped the "Active"
 * badge and green border from every saved account. The user was told,
 * positively and wrongly, that nothing was live.
 *
 * `queries.ts` names this hazard where the two accessors are defined — an empty
 * result "does NOT mean there are no sessions, and the two must never be
 * conflated" — and offers `getActiveSessionsResult` for callers that must not.
 * This is one of them.
 *
 * Its own module because the tri-state and the sentence that explains it belong
 * together, and because the dialog is at its length limit.
