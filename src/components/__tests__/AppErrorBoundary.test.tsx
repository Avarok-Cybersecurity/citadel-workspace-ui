/**
 * The root error boundary is the difference between "something broke" and a
 * white screen. It is also the one failure a user cannot report usefully,
 * because the screen it happened on is gone — so it is worth knowing it works
 * rather than assuming it does.
 *
 * These render a component that throws, which React reports to console.error
 * even when a boundary handles it. Silencing that keeps a passing run readable;
 * it is restored afterwards so a genuine error elsewhere is still visible.
