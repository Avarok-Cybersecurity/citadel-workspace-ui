/**
 * The two destructive choices must be addressable by identity.
 *
 * This modal used to offer "Disconnect" and "Deregister", and its own comment
 * records why it stopped: it "read 'Deregister permanently removes this account
 * from the server' ... as if the difference were obvious". It now says "Sign
 * out" and "Delete account permanently", which is plainly better copy.
 *
 * `previous-sessions` pressed those buttons by their old words. From the day of
 * the rewording it found neither, and three of its checks have reported the
 * PRODUCT as broken ever since: Disconnect Removes, Deregister Removes,
 * Deregister Permanent.
 *
 * Worth noting what this case is not: the spec-copy gate cannot catch it.
 * "Disconnect" and "Deregister" both still appear elsewhere in the app, so
 * those strings exist — just not as the label of the thing being pressed.
 * Existing somewhere is not the same as being the name of the control.
