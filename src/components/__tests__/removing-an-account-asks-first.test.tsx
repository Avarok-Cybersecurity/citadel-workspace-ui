/**
 * Removing a saved account asks first, and clearing all of them asks too.
 *
 * These are the last two `AlertDialog` confirmations in the app that no test at
 * any level exercised. Round 417 found what that costs: a deregistration that
 * silently did nothing for weeks while three checks reported success. Round 418
 * covered the file-manager pair and round 432 the chat-history one; this is the
 * remainder.
 *
 * Both are destructive and neither is undoable from the UI — one forgets a
 * single account, the other forgets every account on the device.
