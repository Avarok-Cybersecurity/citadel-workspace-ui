/**
 * Manage Accounts must not say "No accounts found" before it has looked.

 * Found live (2026-09-30): opened in the first second after the page loaded,
 * the dialog said "No accounts found. Join a workspace to get started." and
 * kept saying it for as long as it stayed open, while the agent held three
 * saved accounts. Reopening it listed them. It copied the in-memory list once,
 * on open, before the agent's answer had arrived.
