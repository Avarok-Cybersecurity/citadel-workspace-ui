/**
 * A Connect has exactly three terminal answers, and registration is a Connect.
 *
 * `connect.rs` returns `ConnectSuccess`, `ConnectFailure` or
 * `SessionAlreadyActive` — nothing else settles it. With
 * `connect_after_register` the internal service re-dispatches a real Connect
 * under the SAME request_id (`register.rs:74-86`), so all three arrive at the
 * registration handler.
 *
 * It handled two. The third fell through to the 30s timeout and reported
 * "Registration timed out" for a registration that had SUCCEEDED — the exact
 * failure `registration-connect-failure.test.ts` was written for, one variant
 * later. The comment describing that failure sits four lines above the branch
 * that was missing.
 *
 * `SessionAlreadyActive` resolves rather than rejects, matching what
 * `useLoginHandler` does with it: a live session for these credentials is the
 * outcome the caller asked for, not an error.
 *
 * Both wire shapes are asserted. The service sends some variants at the top
 * level and some inside `Response`, and matching only one form is how the
 * ConnectFailure branch came to be half-written.
