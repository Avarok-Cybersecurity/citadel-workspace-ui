/**
 * "We could not check" and "nothing is connected" must not look the same.
 *
 * `getActiveSessions()` returns an empty array when the socket is down or the
 * request times out. `AccountManagementDialog` rendered that as fact: the
 * Active Sessions section disappeared and every saved account lost its "Active"
 * badge and its green border, telling the user positively that nothing was
 * live.
 *
 * `queries.ts` names the hazard where the two accessors are defined — an empty
 * result "does NOT mean there are no sessions, and the two must never be
 * conflated" — and offers `getActiveSessionsResult` for callers that must not.
 * This was one of them and used the lenient one.
