/**
 * The first-run prompt, read the way a person meets it.
 *
 * A real deployment's owner could not get through this dialog. The mechanism was
 * never broken -- the request reached the server and was correctly refused -- so
 * everything that failed here is text:
 *
 *   - the field said "Workspace Password", placeholder "Enter the workspace
 *     password", while the connect step one screen earlier says "Workspace
 *     Password (Optional)" for a DIFFERENT secret and the join step before that
 *     asked them to invent a third. They went looking and found the wrong one.
 *   - the helper said "Contact your workspace administrator", and on a server
 *     nobody has claimed there is no administrator: this prompt is how the first
 *     one comes to exist.
 *   - the refusal arrived as "Something went wrong: Failed to update workspace:
 *     Invalid workspace master access password", which they read as a glitch
 *     rather than as a rejected password.
 *
 * RENDERED, not read off the source. `init-modal-does-not-eject.test.ts` asserts
 * this file's TEXT for /master password/i, and a source assertion cannot tell
 * copy the app draws from copy sitting in a comment -- this file's comments
 * contain every phrase below. Everything here goes through the DOM the component
 * actually produces, and the error case is driven through the real submit
 * handler so that the sentence asserted is the sentence a person would see.
