/**
 * Two dialogs at once, one of them blurred behind the other.
 *
 * The person who could not get through first-run setup reported "a modal hidden
 * and blurred behind" the one they were typing into. Join is where that is
 * reproducible: its own overlay is a `fixed inset-0 ... bg-black/60
 * backdrop-blur-sm` div carrying `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`, and it
 * renders TWO further dialogs INSIDE that div -- the connect progress modal and
 * the workspace-not-initialized notice. Each of those paints its own identical
 * scrim, so the wizard card underneath stayed on screen, dimmed twice and
 * blurred, under the notice being read.
 *
 * It is not only a picture. `useDialogOverlay` traps Tab and listens for Escape
 * on the document, and its own comment says why a nesting parent must stand
 * down: "two live traps both listening on the document would answer one Escape
 * twice and fight over focus". Login does exactly that for SecuritySettings
 * (`enabled: !showSecuritySettings`). Join never did -- the same fix, in the
 * same hook, one file away, never carried across.
 *
 * So: exactly one `aria-modal` dialog, whichever nested surface is up.
