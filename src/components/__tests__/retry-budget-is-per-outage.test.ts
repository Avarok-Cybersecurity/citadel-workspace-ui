/**
 * The reconnect budget must be per-outage, and the modal must close on success.
 *
 * `maxRetries` reads as a per-outage budget, but `reset` was never called — the
 * destructure omitted it — so the attempt count accumulated across the tab's
 * entire lifetime. After ten failures spread over hours, every subsequent
 * disconnection opened a modal reading "Failed to reconnect after 10 attempts"
 * with Retry already disabled and no recovery but a reload. Even before
 * exhaustion, each outage inherited the previous count and started at an
 * inflated backoff.
 *
 * Separately, the close-on-success listener waited for `connection-success`,
 * which NOTHING emits — the socket layer emits `on-ws-connection-success` — so a
 * connection recovered by any other path never closed the modal.
 *
 * Asserted on the source with comments stripped, and cross-checked against the
 * emitter: a listener naming an event nobody fires is exactly the defect here,
 * so the test must confirm the name exists on the other side too.
