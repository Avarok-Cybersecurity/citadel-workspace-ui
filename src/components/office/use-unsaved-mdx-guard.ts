 * Protects an in-progress MDX edit from being thrown away without a word.
 *
 * The editor buffer is plain component state. Cancel was a bare toggle, and the
 * workspace view is keyed by node id — so clicking any other node in the
 * sidebar unmounted the editor and the buffer with it, mid-edit, silently.
 * Closing the browser tab did the same. Twenty minutes of writing could go with
 * one stray click and no prompt anywhere.
 *
 * The baseline is captured when editing BEGINS rather than compared against the
 * stored document, because the two differ legitimately: a node with no content
 * yet opens with a template, which the user has not written and must not be
 * warned about.
