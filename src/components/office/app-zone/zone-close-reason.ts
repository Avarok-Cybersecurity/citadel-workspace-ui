/**
 * Why a zone's running app is closed. Pure. Whether the install is gone or no longer reaches this
 * person is read from the install list, never from the view the zone shows next: with another
 * install of the same app covering the page, the next view is that install's (or its disabled
 * placeholder), so an uninstall read from it was an unmount or a revoked access. The list says:
 * the running install absent is `uninstall`; present but no longer covering this person,
 * disabled for them or suspended is `access_revoked`. Otherwise the next view decides between
 * another release (`version_update`) and the zone simply going (`unmount`).
 *
 * AppZone.tsx records the next view and facts in a layout effect of the parent, which React runs
 * in the commit's layout phase, before the passive-effect cleanup that closes the app, so the
 * close carries the reason of the commit that removed or replaced it. A zone whose page goes away
 * keeps the last ones: `unmount`.
