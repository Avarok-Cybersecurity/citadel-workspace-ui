/**
 * Four rounds, four links, and nothing held the chain together.
 *
 * "WARNING: Message input not found" appeared in four integration jobs and had
 * four separate causes, each fixed on its own and each guarded on its own:
 *
 *   369  the Chat tab selection did not survive the remount BaseOffice is keyed
 *        to cause, so the panel went back to Content and took the composer;
 *   373  a node absent from `state.nodes` read as "this room has no chat", so
 *        the whole tab surface was replaced by the document;
 *   378  `usePermission(undefined, ...)` reads as a definite denial, so an
 *        office rendered before its node resolved replaced the composer with
 *        "You do not have permission to send messages here";
 *   379  a permission cache MISS reads the same way, so every user in a
 *        three-user run got that message.
 *
 * Any one of them is enough to lose the composer, and a test per link cannot
 * see that. This walks the whole path with the conditions that were true when
 * each of them bit, and asks the one question the user asks: can I type?
