/**
 * The editor buffer must survive a re-render the user did not cause.
 *
 * `content` is the controlled value of the textarea, and BaseOffice's load
 * effect had no `isEditing` guard. It depended on `getInitialContent`, which was
 * a bare arrow — a new identity on every render of WorkspaceView, which
 * subscribes to the WHOLE workspace store. So a colleague's typing indicator, an
 * incoming message, or a member list arriving anywhere in the app replaced what
 * the user was typing and destroyed the native undo stack with it. On a
 * brand-new node the else branch ran and replaced their work with the default
 * template.
 *
 * Renders the REAL BaseOffice. Only the things it cannot run under jsdom are
 * mocked — MDX compilation and the workspace store — never the effect under
 * test.
