/**
 * `healthCheckService` polls every 10 seconds and emitted `service-health` to

 * nobody. The user met it as scattered per-operation failures, or as silence.
 *
 * The agent runs on localhost, so it can be dead while the device is perfectly
 * online: `useOnlineStatus` cannot see this, and the offline banner — whose own
 * docstring says an installed PWA has no browser chrome to reveal a problem —
 * did not cover it.
