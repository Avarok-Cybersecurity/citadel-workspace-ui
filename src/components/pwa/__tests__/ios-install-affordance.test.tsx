/**
 * iOS users must be told how to install, because their platform cannot offer it.
 *
 * iOS Safari never fires `beforeinstallprompt` — there is no programmatic
 * install on that platform at all — so `canInstall` is permanently false there
 * and `InstallAppButton` rendered nothing. That silently zeroed the install
 * funnel for every iPhone and iPad, on a product whose primary mobile surface is
 * the installed PWA. The manifest and apple-touch-icon groundwork was already
 * in place; only the affordance was missing.
