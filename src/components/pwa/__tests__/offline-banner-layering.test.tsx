/**
 * The offline banner must outrank the surfaces that appear BECAUSE you are
 * offline, and must not overlap the content beneath it.
 *
 * At z-40 it sat under every one of them: the opaque z-50 workspace loader, the
 * z-[100] LoadingModal and the four z-50 auth modals. So an offline launch
 * showed a full-screen "Loading workspace..." with the one explanation of why
 * painted over by the thing that was not loading.
 *
 * It is also `fixed`, so it takes no space — and its offset lands exactly where
 * the h-14 header ends and `pt-14` content begins, covering the first ~36px of
 * both the sidebar and the content pane.
