/**
 * The captured `beforeinstallprompt` event, held outside React.
 *
 * Chromium fires this ONCE per page load, early, and it cannot be requested
 * later — the only way to show an install dialog is to replay the event you
 * caught. It used to be stashed in `useState` inside `usePwaInstall`, with the
 * listener registered in that instance's mount effect. Every consumer therefore
 * had its own listener and its own copy.
 *
 * That broke the ordinary journey. The event fires while the user is on the
 * landing page; signing in unmounts Landing, taking its stashed event with it,
 * and mounts the TopBar consumer *after* the event has already fired. So the
 * user-menu install entry — added precisely because installing was only offered
 * on the landing page — could never appear for anyone who had signed in.
 *
 * Registered at import time from `main.tsx`, before React mounts, for the same
 * reason service-worker registration lives there: nothing that must not be
 * missed should depend on a component being mounted at the right moment.
