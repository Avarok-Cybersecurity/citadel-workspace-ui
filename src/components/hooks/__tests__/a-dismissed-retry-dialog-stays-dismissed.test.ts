/**
 * Dismissing the connection-retry dialog has to mean something.
 *
 * `connection-failure` is emitted every time the WASM client fails to open its
 * socket, and it retries while the agent is down — so the dialog reopened
 * within a second or two of every dismissal, indefinitely. Measured against a
 * build pointed at a dead port: Escape closes it, and it is back before the
 * next check.
 *
 * `WorkspaceApp` already reached this conclusion for the other half of the same
 * condition, suppressing the dialog while the browser reports no network:
 * "two notices for one condition, and the blocking one adds nothing… counting
 * down retries that cannot succeed". The agent being down is that situation
 * with a different cause, and the offline banner has an agent-down state saying
 * so across the top of the app.
