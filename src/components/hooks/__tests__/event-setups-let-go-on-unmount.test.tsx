/**
 * A hook that subscribes must unsubscribe, and these three did not.
 *
 * `workspaceEvents.onMemberEvent`, `onWorkspaceEvent` and `onNodeEvent` return
 * their unsubscribe SYNCHRONOUSLY. `useMemberEventSetup`,
 * `useWorkspaceEventSetup` and `useNodeEventSetup` captured none of them, and
 * their effects returned no cleanup — so every remount
 * left another set of live listeners behind, each retaining a closure over
 * `setState`, and every event afterwards ran an ever-growing pile of dead
 * handlers.
 *
 * Nothing broke visibly, because setState on an unmounted component is a no-op.
 * That is exactly why it accumulated. `use-domain-members` carries the same
 * paragraph about the same mistake — fixed there, and not here.
 *
 * The sibling `useMessageEventSetup` calls `cleanupAllListeners()` on unmount,
 * which does remove these — and every listener this hook never created. Owning
 * your own unsubscribe is not the same as somebody else clearing the room.
 *
 * The table below is the point: the first pass fixed two of the three, which is
 * the house's most productive defect class -- a correct fix applied in one
 * place. Every sibling is listed here so the next one added has to join it.
