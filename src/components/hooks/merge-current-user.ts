/**
 * Fold session identity into `state.currentUser` without discarding what is
 * already there.
 *
 * The workspace-loaded handler used to build a whole new object:
 *
 *   currentUser: { id, username, name, role }
 *
 * `UserRegistrationInfo` carries only username, fullName, serverAddress and
 * serverPassword — there is no avatar in it — so every workspace load replaced
 * a `currentUser` that had an `avatarUrl` with one that did not. The profile
 * update event is the ONLY writer of that field, so the picture a user had just
 * set survived until the next workspace event and then vanished, and a reload
 * never showed it at all.
 *
 * That is the same shape as the recorded workspace-metadata defect: a partial
 * record assigned over a fuller one. Merging is the fix, and doing it in one
 * named function rather than inline is what makes it testable.
