 * Small text transforms applied to raw MDX/markdown content BEFORE the

 * available in the runtime MDX path, so a few GFM features (strike-
 * through, etc.) have to be open-coded.
 *
 * Critically, these transforms must NOT touch the contents of code
 * regions (fenced ```...``` blocks and inline `...` code spans) — doing
 * so would mangle code samples that legitimately contain `~~`. Use the
 * `transformOutsideCode` helper to opt into that behaviour.

 *   1. Fenced code blocks: ```...```  (with optional language tag)
 *   2. Inline code spans: `...` (single backtick, no embedded backticks
 *      or newlines).
 *
 * The `g` flag is required so `RegExp.exec` advances past each match.

 *
 * The body alternative `(?:[^\n]|\n(?!\n))` permits any non-newline
 * char OR a single newline that is NOT followed by another newline.
 * That matches GFM's "no blank line inside a strikethrough" rule —
 * the previous `[\s\S]*?` body would silently wrap an entire
 * `~~para1\n\npara2~~` block in one `<del>`, which then broke MDX
 * paragraph layout. With the new pattern the regex stops at the
 * first `\n\n` and leaves the trailing `~~ ... ~~` literal.
 *
 * Only applied to non-code regions — see `transformOutsideCode`.
