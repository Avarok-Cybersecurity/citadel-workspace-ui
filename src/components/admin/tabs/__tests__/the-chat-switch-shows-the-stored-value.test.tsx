/**
 * The admin Chat tab shows the node's stored chat setting, and nothing until it has one.
 *
 * With the node not yet in the workspace store, the tab rendered its switch ON
 * (`node ? node.chat_enabled : true`): a guess shown as fact, and a Save pressed then would
 * write the guess. Now that new nodes really are created with chat on, the guess would usually
 * be right, which is exactly how it would stop being noticed.
 *
 * No mocks: the tab and the context are production code; only the store's contents are chosen.
