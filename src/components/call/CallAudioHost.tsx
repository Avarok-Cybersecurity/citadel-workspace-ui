 * only in the conversation the call belongs to. Navigating to another chat, the
 * file manager or the directory unmounted every tile — so the peer's audio
 * stopped instantly while the microphone kept transmitting, and nothing on
 * screen said the user was still in a call. They went deaf, stayed audible, and
 * had no way to hang up.
 *
 * This lives under `CallLayer`, above the router, so it is mounted for the whole
 * session and the audio is independent of what the user is looking at.
