 * is already sharing, that is what the room is looking at. Two screens side by
 * side halves both of them, which defeats the purpose — people share screens so
 * that others can READ something.
 *
 * A participant must be BOTH sending screen frames and announcing `media.screen`
 * to hold the stage. The frames alone would keep a stopped share up on the last
 * frame it sent, and the announcement alone would open an empty stage.
