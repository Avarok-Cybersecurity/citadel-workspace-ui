/**
 * The camera toggle must not report a camera the call does not have.
 *
 * `captureLocalMedia` falls back to audio-only when video fails — a blocked
 * camera, no camera at all — and that fallback is right: a call worth having
 * beats no call. But the fallback returned `ok: true` with no other signal, so
 * nothing told the user. Then pressing "Turn camera on" enabled zero video
 * tracks, flipped the button to on, and announced `video: true` to every peer,
 * whose tiles showed a camera badge for a stream that would never arrive.
 *
 * Two independent audits found this the same week, from opposite directions —
 * one looking for silent failures, one for call-state divergence.
