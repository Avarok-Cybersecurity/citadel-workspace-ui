/**
 * Whether a call's own surface is currently on screen.
 *
 * `CallStage` mounts only inside the conversation the call belongs to, so the
 * app cannot otherwise tell "the user is looking at their call" from "the user
 * is in a call and has navigated somewhere else". That distinction is what
 * decides whether to show the ongoing-call bar.
 *
 * A counter rather than a boolean: the stage can briefly mount twice while a
 * route transition swaps layouts, and a boolean would flip to false on the
 * unmount of the old one.
