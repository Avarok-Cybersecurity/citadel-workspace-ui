/**
 * The human check on one form (sign-in or registration).
 *
 * It asks discovery on open, shows the check when the workspace requires it,
 * and hands each attempt one fresh token: Turnstile tokens are single-use, so a
 * token is taken once and the widget is reset for the next attempt whatever
 * the outcome. A server refusal overrides discovery in both directions --
 * `admission_required` reveals the check even if discovery said no (or could
 * not answer), `admission_failed` resets it with a retry message.
