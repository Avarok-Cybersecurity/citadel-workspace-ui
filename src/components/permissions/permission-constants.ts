/**
 * UI presentation for the permission model.
 *
 * The model itself is not defined here. `Permission`, `PERMISSION_LABELS` and
 * `PERMISSION_CATEGORIES` live in `lib/permissions-service/types.ts`, which mirrors the Rust enum in
 * citadel-workspace-types. This file adds the one thing that is genuinely
 * UI-only — a sentence of explanatory copy per permission — and reshapes the
 * canonical categories into what the permission matrix renders.
 *
 * It used to hold a second, hand-written copy of both the category list and the
 * role defaults, and both had drifted: the categories covered 16 of the 27
 * permissions, so the matrix could not grant the rest at all, and the defaults
 * offered Member `EditContent`, which the server refuses. An administrator was
 * shown a role that did not exist. scripts/check-permission-parity.mjs now fails
 * the build if the mirror and the Rust enum disagree.
 *
 * What each ROLE grants is not here either, nor anywhere in the UI: roles are an
 * editable table the server holds, read live (lib/workspace-roles).
