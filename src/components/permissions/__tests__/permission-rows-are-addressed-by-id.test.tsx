/**
 * The permission rows must be findable by something that does not change when
 * somebody improves the wording.
 *
 * `permission-matrix-phone.spec.ts` guards one thing: that at 375px the label
 * column stays on screen instead of sliding off the left edge, where the
 * permission names become unreachable. To measure that it first has to find a
 * row. It found one with `getByText('Edit MDX Content')`.
 *
 * The label became "Can edit MDX documents". From that day the spec waited
 * thirty seconds for text that no longer existed, failed, and the assertion it
 * was actually there to make never ran once — in CI, on every run, while the
 * failure read as a broken test rather than as a guard that had stopped
 * guarding.
 *
 * This test holds the id-shaped handle in place. It is deliberately about the
 * ATTRIBUTE and not the words: an assertion on the label would reintroduce
 * exactly what went wrong.
