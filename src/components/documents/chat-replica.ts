/**
 * A chat document in the Citadel Docs canvas, kept live between the two people of a 1:1 chat
 * over their P2P channel (lib/cdoc/chat): no workspace server, so its content never leaves
 * the two agents. What the chat's wiring opens: `openChatDocument` gives DocumentHost its
 * `editing` arm, the title to show and the rename to offer. Everything it runs is loaded on
 * first open, so neither the sync nor cdoc is in the shell's bundle (types only from cdoc).
 *
 * Always live, so there is no Save control. Pictures cannot be inserted yet: a chat has no
 * content store, so the other person would see an empty box where the picture is.
