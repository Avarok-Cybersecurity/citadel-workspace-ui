/**
 * A received file's bubble does what its hint says.
 *
 * Live (admin-lab): a completed direct P2P transfer read "Downloaded — Click to
 * open file", and clicking did nothing: the click required `virtual_path`,
 * which only a staged (server) transfer carries. It now hands the transfer to
 * the chat, which shows where the agent saved it (FilePreviewDialog). Mocked
 * as in a-transfer-bubble-tells-the-truth: the agent socket and the tab's
 * session lookup, the two I/O boundaries the bubble's service reaches.
