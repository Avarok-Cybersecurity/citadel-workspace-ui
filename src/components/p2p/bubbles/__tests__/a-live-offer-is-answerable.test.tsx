/**
 * Seen live: a file offer arrived in the recipient's open DM and rendered at
 * once as "Offer expired — ask the sender to send it again", with no Accept.
 *
 * The bubble calls an offer with no service record "restored" -- unanswerable
 * -- unless the service marked it as arriving during this page's life. That
 * mark and the record are written by FileTransferService's listener for
 * `p2p:file-transfer-message`. The listener lives in the service module, which
 * the build puts in a chunk only the page components import; the inbound P2P
 * router that EMITS the event is in `app-services-deferred`, which index loads
 * on its own. An offer routed before the service module was evaluated was
 * emitted to nobody: no mark, no record, and the protocol half's join never
 * made either -- a live offer rendered as a dead one.
 *
 * Replayed here in the receiver's real order: the sender's announcement,
 * encoded and decoded as the wire does, through the real inbound router and
 * the real FileTransferMessageHandler, with the service module NOT yet
 * imported -- then the bubble renders the entry the handler stored. Mocked:
 * the socket, the tab's session lookup (IndexedDB) and the auto-connect
 * service (a network singleton the router pings).
