/**
 * A conversation switch must not carry the previous peer's messages.
 *
 * `useP2PMessages` resets `messages` only when `peerCid` is FALSY, so switching
 * from Alice to Bob left the array populated — and `mergeMessages` dedups by
 * message id alone, never by peer, so Alice's messages merged into Bob's thread
 * by timestamp. `P2PMessageList` labels every non-own message with the CURRENT
 * `peerName`, so they rendered as if Bob had sent them.
 *
 * The fix is a `key` on the component, which is a React-level property these
 * tests cannot observe. What they CAN pin is why a stale array was dangerous:
 * mergeMessages will silently interleave two peers' history if it is ever
 * handed one. If the key is later removed, or a cross-peer merge reintroduced,
 * this states plainly what the function does and does not guarantee.
