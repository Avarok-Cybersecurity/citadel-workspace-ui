/**
 * An Accept that fails must tell the person who pressed it.
 *
 * Seen live: Accept on a restored offer produced only a console line,
 * `[UseP2PFileTransfer] Failed to accept transfer: Error: Transfer not found`.
 * The bubble no longer offers Accept on such an offer (see
 * a-transfer-bubble-tells-the-truth), but any accept can still fail, and the
 * failure must reach the screen with its reason.
 *
 * The real service rejects here (no such transfer); the toast is rendered by
 * the app's real Sonner toaster. Mocked: the theme provider the toaster reads,
 * and the socket the service module would otherwise open.
