/**
 * What the discovery modal does with a `PeerRegisterFailure`.
 *
 * Two outcomes, and they are opposites. "Already registered" is a SUCCESS
 * wearing the Failure variant — see
 * `lib/peer-registration-store/already-registered.ts` — so the row is marked
 * registered and nothing is said. Anything else is a genuine refusal and is
 * reported by name.
 *
 * A refusal used to reach only `debugLog`, compiled out in production, so the
 * user was told "Request Sent" and then nothing. It is correlated by
 * `request_id`, because `PeerRegisterFailure` carries no `peer_cid`.
 *
 * WHICH PEER IS NOT IN THE RESPONSE, AND MUST NOT BE READ FROM IT. The variant
 * carries `cid`, and that is the LOCAL SESSION's id -- the peer appears only
 * inside the message text. This branch read `failure.cid` and put it in a Set
 * keyed by PEER cid, so the user's own id was marked registered and the peer's
 * row stayed unmarked. Since CIDs are permanent, every reconnect re-registers,
 * gets "already registered" back, and lands here: the row never marks, the
 * branch says nothing by design, and pressing Connect again is a silent no-op
 * for as long as the user keeps trying. The sibling `PeerRegisterSuccess`
 * branch reads `peer_cid` and is correct.
 *
 * So the outcome no longer carries a cid at all. The caller correlated the
 * request and knows the peer; it passes it in. A value that cannot be right
 * should not be available to read.
 *
 * Extracted because `usePeerDiscovery` crossed the 250-line limit, and because
 * the decision is worth reading on its own: telling the user "your request was
 * not accepted" about a peer who IS registered is the opposite of what happened,
 * and leaves the row unmarked so they try again.
