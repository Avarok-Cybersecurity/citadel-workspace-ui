/**
 * Clearing a conversation asks first, and a refusal clears nothing.
 *
 * Round 418 found the file-manager delete paths behind a `confirm({...})` that
 * no test at any level exercised, and round 417 found what that costs: a
 * deregistration that silently did nothing while three checks reported success.
 * This was the third such guard, and the last one still uncovered.
 *
 * The button also had no testid, so nothing could address it. Its own comment
 * records the previous defect here -- it used to remove a localStorage key
 * nothing in the app has ever written, so it cleared nothing while the dialog
 * promised the messages were gone.
