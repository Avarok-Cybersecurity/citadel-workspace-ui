/**
 * A reader scrolled up must not be yanked to the bottom.
 *
 * The scroll effect pinned unconditionally on every change of `messages`, and
 * the status subscription's `prev.map` ALWAYS allocates — so the array identity
 * changed for a sent/delivered/read transition in ANY conversation, not just
 * this one. Someone reading yesterday's thread was thrown back to the newest
 * message by a delivery receipt in a completely different chat.
 *
 * It also fought the pagination anchoring in useP2PMessages, which goes to real
 * trouble to preserve scroll position across a prepend.
 *
 * Two halves, tested separately: this file covers the identity half (the cheap,
 * deterministic one); the geometric half is asserted in the integration suite,
 * because jsdom reports every element as 0x0 and cannot see a scroll position.
