/**
 * `PeerRegisterFailure` names the LOCAL session, never the peer.
 *
 * The wire type is `{ cid, message, request_id }` — no `peer_cid` — and `cid`
 * is the session's own id (citadel-internal-service .../peer/register.rs). The
 * already-registered branch read `failure.cid` into a Set keyed by PEER cid, so
 * the user's own id was marked and the peer's row never was. CIDs are permanent,
 * so every reconnect re-registers, gets "already registered" back, and lands
 * here: pressing Connect again is a silent no-op indefinitely.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than a corrected field read — the outcome carries
 * no cid at all, so there is nothing wrong left to reach for. These tests assert
 * that shape, because a later "helpful" restoration of `cid` is exactly how this
 * comes back.
