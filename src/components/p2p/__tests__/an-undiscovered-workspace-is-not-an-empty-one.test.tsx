/**
 * "We could not load the people here" and "there is nobody here" are different
 * sentences, and the modal said the second when it meant the first.
 *
 * `usePeerDiscovery` initialised its list to `[]` and left it there when
 * discovery failed. `PeerDiscoveryModal` renders `[]` as:
 *
 *     No other users in this workspace yet
 *     People who join this workspace appear here…
 *
 * which is a confident claim about the workspace, made on the strength of a
 * query that did not answer. There IS a failure toast beside it — and a toast
 * is transient, so what remains on screen after it fades is the sentence that
 * contradicts it, on the one screen whose purpose is finding somebody to talk
 * to.
