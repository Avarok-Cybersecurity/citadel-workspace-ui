/**
 * The landing page says which accounts the server signed out while no page was open.
 *
 * The agent keeps a give-up in GetSessions' `signed_out` until the account signs
 * in again. Before, such an account just vanished and nothing said why.
 *
 * MOCKS, and why: `@/lib/connection` is the agent's WebSocket, which a unit test
 * does not have; its GetSessions answer is the input under test. The hook, the
 * copy and the notice are the real code.
