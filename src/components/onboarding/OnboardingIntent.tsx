/**
 * The one question the product never asked, and should have.
 *
 * "Create Account" against a bare workspace address does two entirely different
 * jobs depending on who you are, and the UI has never distinguished them:
 *
 *   - the FIRST person is setting up a workspace and will be asked, after
 *     registering, for the operator's WORKSPACE_MASTER_PASSWORD in order to
 *     become the administrator (WorkspaceInitializationModal);
 *   - everyone after them is joining, and cannot possibly hold that secret.
 *
 * Today both see the same wizard, and the master password is first mentioned in
 * a modal that appears AFTER the account exists. A member who arrives before
 * anyone has initialised is shown that modal too, asking for a secret they have
 * no way to obtain -- the hazard recorded in
 * src/components/__tests__/init-modal-does-not-eject.test.ts. Naming the two
 * paths before the wizard is what removes that surprise.
 *
 * This does NOT branch the registration flow: both paths run the same three
 * steps. It sets expectations, and tells an administrator to have the master
 * password to hand BEFORE they need it rather than after.
