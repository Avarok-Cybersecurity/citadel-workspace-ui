/**
 * The profile step's field errors, as a pure function of what has been typed.
 *
 * Two lists, deliberately:
 *
 *  - `rawErrors` is what is wrong right now. The submit path reads it, because a
 *    submit must not be let through on the grounds that the user has not
 *    visited the field yet.
 *  - `fieldErrors` is what the user is shown, which is the same thing filtered
 *    by whether they have left the field or tried to submit. Telling someone
 *    their one-character username is too short while they are still typing it is
 *    noise, not help.
 *
 * The rules themselves are the SDK's, enforced server-side; checking here means
 * the user learns about the 17-character password maximum while typing rather
 * than after a round trip.
