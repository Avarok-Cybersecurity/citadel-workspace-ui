/**
 * The count of connection requests waiting for an answer.
 *
 * A real button, not a clickable Badge: Badge renders a div, so this was
 * invisible to the keyboard and announced as nothing — and it is one of only
 * two ways to open the pending-requests modal (the other is a click-only
 * notification card), which made that whole surface unreachable without a
 * mouse.
 *
 * The destructive variant, not a raw red: `bg-red-500` with `text-foreground`
 * is about 3.9:1 in dark mode — below AA at this size — and a raw hex is
 * invisible to the workspace theme.
