/**
 * "Workspace settings" is in ADMIN SETTINGS for whoever holds UpdateWorkspace, and opens the
 * settings dialog.
 *
 * Live (owner, 2026-09-27): nothing opened settings for the workspace itself. The item is gated on
 * the permission the server checks for UpdateWorkspaceProfile, so it is not offered to an admin
 * the server would refuse.
 *
 * Stubbed: usePermission, the permission fetch (server I/O); the gate reads its answer through
 * the production `permits`. The section, dialog and contexts are production code.
