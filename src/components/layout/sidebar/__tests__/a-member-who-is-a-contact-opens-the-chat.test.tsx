/**
 * Clicking a member who is also a contact opens the conversation.
 *
 * Found in #182's CI and then as a UX problem (2026-09-29): a node's member list
 * now lists everyone who can use the node, so the same person shows as a member
 * and as a contact, and the member row did nothing when clicked. Real: the row
 * component; the chat opener is the prop MemberListBody passes.
