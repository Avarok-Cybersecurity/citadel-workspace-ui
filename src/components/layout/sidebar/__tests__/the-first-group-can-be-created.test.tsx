/**
 * You must be able to create your FIRST group chat.
 *
 * The only control that opens the create-group dialog lives inside the
 * CONVERSATIONS section, and that whole section was rendered only when
 *
 *   peersWithConversations.length > 0 || groupConversations.length > 0
 *
 * — that is, only once you already had a conversation. A user who had registered
 * peers and had not yet talked to anyone had no way to start a group at all.
 *
 * CI found it as three fresh accounts, P2P registered and accepted on the first
 * attempt, and then:
 *
 *   peergrp_1: Creating group "TestGroup_3" with 2 members...
 *   New Group button not found in sidebar
 *
 * which reads as a missing button and is a missing entry point.
 *
 * Rendered rather than reasoned about: the section is real, the hooks are
 * stubbed at their boundary, and the assertion is on what a person can press.
