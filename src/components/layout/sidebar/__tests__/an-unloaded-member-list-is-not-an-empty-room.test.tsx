/**
 * "We could not load the people here" and "nobody else is here" are different
 * sentences, and the sidebar said the second when it meant the first.
 *
 * `use-domain-members` clears its loading flag when the request to `listMembers`
 * fails, and again when nothing answers within `MEMBER_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`. Both
 * leave the list empty, and the section renders an empty list as:
 *
 *     Nobody else is here yet. Invite someone with the share button above…
 *
 * a claim about the workspace, on the strength of a request that never arrived.
 * The hook's own note frames the timeout as a choice between an indefinite
 * spinner and that empty state. There is a third answer.
