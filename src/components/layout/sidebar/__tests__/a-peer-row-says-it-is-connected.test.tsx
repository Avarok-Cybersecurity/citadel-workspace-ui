/**
 * A peer's row must be findable by name and must say its own status.
 *
 * `connectP2P` verified a connection by walking into a sidebar section headed
 * "CONNECTED PEERS" and looking for the peer inside it. That heading was
 * deliberately removed: the members list called itself "Workspace Members",
 * "Connected Peers" or "<Entity> Members" depending on state the user could not
 * see, and was given one noun. From that day the locator matched nothing, the
 * check could never pass, and every P2P connection was reported as
 *
 *   FAIL: P2P connect to X sent, but the peer never appeared as connected
 *
 * which reads as a protocol failure and is a heading that changed. It is the
 * only verification that function has.
 *
 * The row's own status text is what the helper reads now — the same string a
 * screen reader is given, so the check and the accessibility affordance stand
 * or fall together.
 *
 * Both inputs later gained a third value. `isOnline` came from a poll set that
 * is empty before the first refresh, so every peer read "Offline" until it
 * landed; `isConnected` came from `Promise.race([check, timeoutAfter(1000)])`
 * with the timeout resolving `false`, which is a stopwatch rather than an
 * answer — a connected peer whose check was slow rendered as merely online.
 * Null now gets its own words instead of borrowing the negative's.
