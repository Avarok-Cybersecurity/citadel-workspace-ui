/**
 * "Your workspace is empty. Click the + button to create your first space" is
 * advice, and it was given after a load that never came back.
 *
 * `loading-flag-timeout.ts` lowers the flag after 15s so the tree cannot spin
 * forever, and its docstring calls the empty state "the honest fallback …
 * at least a statement the user can act on". For a LIST that is true. For this
 * one it is not: acting on it creates a duplicate space in a workspace whose
 * contents merely did not arrive.
 *
 * `use-domain-members` had already reached the third answer for members —
 * "there is a third answer, which is to say what happened" — and the tree, the
 * most-used surface in the app, was left on the second.
