/**
 * The account menu must have a name even when the user has a profile picture.
 *
 * Radix unmounts `AvatarFallback` once the image loads, so the initials that
 * were carrying the person's name disappear at exactly the moment a real
 * picture exists. This button has no text content of its own, so the only route
 * to Profile, Settings and Sign out was announced as "button". Its `title` was
 * admin-only, so non-admins had nothing at all.
 *
 * Asserts on the BUTTON's accessible name rather than on the avatar, because
 * that is what survives both the fallback unmounting and the image failing to
 * load.
