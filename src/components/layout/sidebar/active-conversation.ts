/**
 * Which conversation the sidebar should show as the one you are looking at.

 * The hierarchy tree marks the selected node; the conversation list below it
 * marked nothing. `GroupConversationRow` has carried an `isActive` prop, and
 * the styling to go with it, since it was written -- and its only caller never
 * passed one. `PeerListRow` had no such prop at all. So with several
 * conversations opened over a session, nothing in the sidebar said which one
 * was on screen.
 *
 * The route already knows. A peer conversation is `?showP2P=true&channel=<cid>`
 * on whatever workspace path you are on; a group is `/groups/<id>`. Read here,
 * as a pure function of the location, so the rule can be tested without a
 * router and so the two row types cannot come to disagree about it.
