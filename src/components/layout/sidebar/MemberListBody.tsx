 * outcomes are one decision — loading, empty, or a list.
 *
 * There is always a domain. `activeDomainId` was `params.get("nodeId")` alone,
 * so on /workspace with no node selected -- the view everyone lands on after
 * signing in -- it was null, nothing was asked, and a guard here rendered
 * nothing at all: no spinner, no empty state, no members. That guard existed
 * because an earlier revision rendered "Nobody else is here yet" for the same
 * null. Both were answers to a question that should not arise: with no node
 * selected the view IS the workspace root, and MembersSection now asks for it.
