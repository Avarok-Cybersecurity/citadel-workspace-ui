/**
 * The actions at the top of the members list.
 *
 * There was one, and it was the wrong one to have alone: "find people already
 * in this workspace". The product had no answer at all to "get somebody into
 * this workspace" — no invite link, no share surface, no copy button — so the
 * first person to set one up, wanting their teammate in, found nothing.
 *
 * Then a third: "Add member". `MemberManagementModal mode="add"` had a form, a
 * handler and a server command behind it, and no button anywhere opened it —
 * the only way to admit someone by name was a modal nothing could reach. It is
 * disabled, with the reason, when the server is known to refuse (AddUsers), not
 * hidden: a control that vanishes tells nobody that the permission exists.
 *
 * Its glyph is a person-with-check, not a second person-plus: the discovery
 * button keeps `UserPlus`, which the P2P registration specs locate it by.
