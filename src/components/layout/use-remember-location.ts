/**
 * Recording where this session is, for the next time it is claimed.

 * An in-tab refresh keeps its place because the URL is the state. The second
 * session — landing page → Active Sessions → claim — navigated to the workspace
 * root with no params, so somebody who closed the browser mid-conversation came
 * back tomorrow and landed on the default office, re-finding it by hand.
 *
 * Written on every location change rather than on unload: `beforeunload` is not
 * reliably delivered on mobile or on a crash, and those are exactly the closes
 * that end a session without warning.
