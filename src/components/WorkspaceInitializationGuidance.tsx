/**
 * What the initialization prompt is actually asking for, in words.
 *
 * A separate component because WorkspaceInitializationModal is at the 250-line
 * cap and this is prose, not logic -- but also because this text is the fix. The
 * modal is a correct, working mechanism that a real deployment's owner could not
 * get through, and the reason was never the code:
 *
 *   - The field said "Workspace Password" with the placeholder "Enter the
 *     workspace password". The product has THREE different passwords in the
 *     first five minutes -- the account password the user picks in the join
 *     wizard, the optional server password on the connect step (ServerConnect
 *     labels that one "Workspace Password (Optional)", which is the same two
 *     words), and this one. Nothing anywhere said which.
 *   - The helper text said "Contact your workspace administrator if you don't
 *     have the password", and on a brand-new deployment there IS no
 *     administrator. This prompt is how the first one comes to exist. It sent
 *     the only person who could complete it to ask somebody who does not exist.
 *
 * So this names the variable (`WORKSPACE_MASTER_PASSWORD`) and where an operator
 * put it, distinguishes it from the password the user chose minutes earlier, and
 * says plainly what happens to somebody who does not have it -- because that is
 * most people who see this dialog, and the honest answer is that they can walk
 * away from it and keep working.
 *
 * The variable NAME, never a value. Nothing on this screen may echo, log or
 * pre-fill the secret itself.
