/**
 * Deleting, and saying what happened.
 *
 * Split out of `useFileManagerHandlers` at the 250-line cap, mirroring
 * `useFileManagerSelectionHandlers` beside it. The two belong together: both
 * ask before destroying anything, both route a directory to `rmdir` and a file
 * to `removeFile`, and both now report the outcome either way.
 *
 * The single-item path used to announce only its failures. `revfsService.rmdir`
 * takes a per-peer serial lock, and a measured run put 7.8 seconds between the
 * confirm click and the operation even starting -- queued behind the previous
 * step's peer ack -- so a success that says nothing is a closed dialog and then
 * eight seconds of silence.
