/**
 * The file manager's error screen was a terminal state.
 *
 * `FileManagerContent` swaps the whole browser for `ErrorScreen` on any tree
 * failure, and the screen rendered an icon, a heading and the raw error -- no
 * control of any kind. The hook has always exposed `refresh`; the screen just
 * never offered it. So one timed-out fetch on a flaky link (the tree request
 * carries a 30s budget) painted a permanent dead end for a transient blip, and
 * the only way out was to navigate away and come back.
