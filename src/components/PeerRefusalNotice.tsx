/**
 * Tell somebody their peer registration request was refused.
 *
 * The store clears the outgoing request when the refusal arrives — and before
 * round 463 it did not even do that, because it keyed the cleanup on a
 * `peer_cid` that `PeerRegisterFailure` does not carry. Once it was cleared,
 * the request simply disappeared from the outgoing list with no word about why.
 *
 * `usePeerDiscovery` already says something, but only while the discovery modal
 * is open, and only for requests sent from that modal — it correlates through
 * an in-memory ref that dies with the component. A refusal arrives when the
 * other person gets round to answering, which is usually long after the modal
 * has closed, so in practice the silent path was the normal one.
 *
 * A component rather than a toast from the store: that is library code, and
 * business logic reaching for the toaster is what SBIO exists to prevent. Same
 * arrangement as `PersistFailureNotice` beside it.
 *
 * Renders nothing. It exists to be mounted.
