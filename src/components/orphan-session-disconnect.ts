 *
 * Signing out an orphan requires OWNING it first. The service's ownership gate
 * refuses any request for a session another connection holds, and an orphan's
 * holder is the connection that opened it — so this was refused every time, in
 * silence until round 309 and with an honest message after it. Claiming is the
 * designed way to take one over, and `handleNavigate` has always done it before
 * touching a session.
 *
 * One outcome is a genuine refusal and the rest are not. `already-active` means
 * the session is live and no tab of this browser holds it; the sign-out is then
 * worth attempting, and the service answers for itself if it disagrees.
