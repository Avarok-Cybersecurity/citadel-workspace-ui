/**
 * "New message from alice" is a control, and it did nothing.
 *
 * Two ends, neither meeting:
 *
 *   1. `message-arrival-notification.ts` supplied the callback as `onOpen`,
 *      while `NotificationItem` reads `data.onCardClick`. Different key, so
 *      the click found nothing to run.
 *   2. The callback emitted `p2p:open-conversation`, and nothing anywhere
 *      listened for it.
 *
 * Either alone was enough, so fixing one would have looked like no change.
 *
 * A third, smaller thing sat beside them: `isClickable` — which decides the
 * pointer cursor and nothing else — required `type === PEER_REGISTRATION`, so
 * a message card gave the reader no sign it would do anything. The first
 * version of this file called that "not clickable", and a control proved
 * otherwise: restoring the type gate changed no behaviour and failed no test.
 * The affordance is asserted below on its own terms.
