/**
 * Multi-window sessions: one account in several windows (agent 0.8.6, mw5).
 *
 * A1 and A2 are two browser CONTEXTS signed in as A -- separate storage, so
 * separate WebSockets and two agent connections attached to one session. B is a
 * third context. A1b is a second TAB in A1's context: the same-browser case.
 *
 *   1. A and B are created and P2P-registered (existing helpers).
 *   2. A1 is signed in as A.
 *   3. A2 opens A with "Open here too" and A's password. Both show A; A1 is not displaced.
 *   4. B -> A: shown exactly once in A1 AND A2.
 *   5. A replies from A2: B receives it, and A1 shows it from the agent's store event.
 *   6. A2 closes. A1 still receives from B.
 *   7. A2 reopens and rejoins with its sealed token, without a prompt; A1b opens A
 *      as a second tab. B -> A reaches A1, A1b and A2, once each.
 *   8. A1 signs out. A2 is told, and A is gone from the agent for every window.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROLS (by reasoning; this suite is run by CI, not here):
 *
 *  NC1 fan-out (steps 4, 6, 7). Delivery is a bubble counted inside A2's chat,
 *      after a presence wait. If the agent delivered session notifications to
 *      one connection only (mw1's fan-out absent), A2's count stays 0, the
 *      presence wait times out, and the step is red. The locator is the same
 *      one that finds the bubble in B's own window in the same call, so a
 *      selector that can never match would fail there too, not pass here.
 *  NC2 exactly once (steps 4, 5, 7). The count is sampled for six seconds after
 *      arrival and judged on its maximum. A window that rendered both its own
 *      optimistic bubble and the store's Appended event for the reply in step
 *      5, or a notification delivered twice, reaches 2 and is red.
 *  NC3 the silent rejoin (step 7). "No prompt" is not an absence sample: a
 *      MutationObserver reports every prompt the instant it enters the DOM,
 *      and step 3 asserts that the same observer, in the same context, on the
 *      same chip click, DID record both the question and the password form.
 *      Without a remembered token claim-session.ts answers
 *      held-by-another-connection and offers the same question, so the count
 *      would be 1 and the step red -- and the workspace would never open, so
 *      the positive check fails as well.
 *  NC4 A1 not displaced (steps 3-4). If "Open here too" moved the session
 *      instead of joining it, A1 would be Detached and stop receiving: step 4's
 *      A1 delivery fails. That delivery, not the absence of a notice, is the
 *      load-bearing check.
 *  NC5 logout ends it for all (step 8). A2 must receive a DisconnectNotification
 *      for A's cid with no request_id, captured from its WebSocket. If logout
 *      only detached A1, no frame arrives, and A stays listed by the agent, so
 *      the second check -- A's chip absent from a freshly loaded strip in which
 *      B's chip IS present -- is red too.
 *
 * Note: the UI shows no change of its own when another window signs the
 * session out (connection/message-handling.ts only clears state), so step 8
 * asserts what A2 is told and what the agent then holds, not a screen.
