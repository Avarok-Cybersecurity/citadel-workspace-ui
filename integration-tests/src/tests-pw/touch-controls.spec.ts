/**
 * Row actions have to be operable on a touch device.
 *
 * Eight controls were written as `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`. On a
 * phone there is no hover, so the reveal never fires and the control is not
 * hard to find but unreachable — that took Edit, Admin Settings and Delete off
 * the node tree, and reply/edit/delete off every message, for anyone using the
 * installed PWA.
 *
 * Nothing caught it because every check ran a desktop browser with a mouse.
 * axe saw an element that was present and labelled; the tap-target and overflow
 * scans measured geometry, and the geometry was fine — the element was laid
 * out, merely transparent. Even the 375px screenshots were captured by a
 * browser reporting `hover: hover`, so they showed desktop behaviour at phone
 * width. Resizing a window does not make a phone.
 *
 * So this emulates touch properly and asserts the control can actually be
 * operated, rather than photographing it.
