/**
 * Multi-Tab Synchronization — Playwright Test spec
 *
 * Tests the multi-tab leader/follower pattern (Section 6 in TESTING_CHECKLIST.md).
 * Previously marked "Not yet tested".
 *
 * Tests:
 * 1. Open app in two tabs within the same browser context
 * 2. Login in first tab → verify second tab syncs
 * 3. Test leader/follower tab behavior
 * 4. Close leader tab → verify follower takes over
