/**
 * Promoting a member has to actually give them the rights of the new role.
 *
 * The role model is a hierarchy — Member reads, Owner and Admin edit — and the
 * admin panel is the only way to move someone up it. Nothing tested that the
 * move had any effect. `tests/member-management.test.ts` asserts the role
 * dropdown is *visible* and stops there, so `UpdateMemberRole` could have been
 * a no-op, or could have set the role without applying the role's permissions,
 * and the suite would have stayed green.
 *
 * It could not have been tested before, either: no account in a deployed
 * workspace was ever an administrator, so nobody could reach this panel. Two
 * defects fell out of fixing that, both of which this spec would have caught —
 * Owner did not carry EditMdx, so a promoted member still could not edit, and
 * Owner lacked ViewContent and SendMessages, so promotion actively took
 * capability away.
 *
 * The member reloads before the second assertion. That is deliberate and not a
 * hidden weakness: the claim under test is that the *server* grants the rights,
 * and there is no push of a role change to an open session. Live propagation of
 * a role change would be a separate feature and a separate spec.
