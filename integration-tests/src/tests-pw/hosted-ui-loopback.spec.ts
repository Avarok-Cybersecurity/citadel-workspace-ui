/**
 * A hosted page reaches the agent on the visitor's own machine.
 *
 * The page is served from a NON-loopback host (work.test, which Chromium is told resolves to
 * 127.0.0.1); the agent listens on wss://local.test:PORT with a certificate for that name
 * (self-signed here, so the browser is told to accept it). What is asserted is what the
 * browser DID: which WebSocket it opened, and that frames came back over it -- so the meta the
 * image renders, the CSP it serves, the resolver's choice, the agent's TLS and its Origin and
 * Host checks are all on the line at once. A unit test of any one of them cannot see the
 * others disagreeing.
 *
 * The second test is the control for the first: the same image, opened from a loopback host,
 * must NOT dial the published origin -- a locally-served page reaches its agent through the
 * same-origin /ws proxy, which is where that proxy is safe.
 *
 * Driven by scripts/test-hosted-ui-loopback.sh in the parent repository, which starts the
 * pieces and sets HOSTED_UI_URL, LOCAL_UI_URL and LOOPBACK_AGENT_URL. Without them there is
 * nothing to test against; the spec says so rather than passing vacuously.
