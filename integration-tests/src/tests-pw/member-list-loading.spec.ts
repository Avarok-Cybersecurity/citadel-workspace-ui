 * in a `finally` attached to that send. For the whole gap between request and
 * response it rendered the definitive empty state: "No members yet. Use the +
 * button to discover peers", about a workspace that had members and was merely
 * fetching them. That is KNOWN_ISSUES #6, which had stood as "needs
 * re-verification".
 *
 * The admin panel's own members tab already did this correctly — it clears
 * loading in the event handler — so the right implementation existed in the
 * codebase and the sidebar simply never got it.
 *
 * Asserting the END state would not catch this: the list is correct a moment
 * later. This samples continuously across the load and fails if the empty state
 * is ever shown, which is the only way a transient wrong answer is visible to a
 * test.
