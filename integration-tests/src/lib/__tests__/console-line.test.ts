/**
 * A cut console line must not read as a complete one.
 *
 * The realtime printer cut at 150 characters. The WASM tracing formatter puts
 * `%cWARN%c`, a container-absolute source path and another `%c` in front of
 * every message, which is around 110 of those characters — so what reached CI
 * was the prefix and the first few characters of the message.
 *
 * For a stuck ILM link that produced:
 *
 *   [ILM-BLOCKED-RECOVERY] CID 15079777622326333560 -> peer 15
 *
 * The peer is `15079777622326333560`. `15` is a plausible CID, nothing marked
 * the line as cut, and a reader would have chased a peer that does not exist.
