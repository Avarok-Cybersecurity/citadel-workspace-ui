/**
 * The console keywords a run must keep when the composer is involved.
 *
 * `OfficeChatTabs` logs `[OfficeChatTabs] composer withheld {...}` when it
 * removes the composer -- the one line that says WHICH of the permission
 * states produced the refusal. The legacy `tests/` specs call
 * `setupConsoleCapture` and their keyword lists do match it (`OfficeChatTabs`
 * lowercases to something containing "chat"), but no `tests-pw` spec captures
 * console output at all. `touch-controls.spec.ts` builds its own context and
 * attaches nothing, so when its send failed, the run reported "Message input
 * not found" and the app's own explanation went to a console nobody read.
 *
 * One list, exported, so a spec does not have to guess which words to keep --
 * and a test asserting it really does match the line the app emits, because a
 * filter that silently matches nothing is the same defect wearing a filter.
